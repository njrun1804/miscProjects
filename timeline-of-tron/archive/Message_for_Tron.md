Hey Tron — I went down a full Timeline of Tron rabbit hole (like, *all* of them) and pulled together some "you would appreciate this" stats, throwbacks, and patterns. You built something genuinely wild here and I wanted to show you the view from the outside.

**THE PROJECT ITSELF**

You've effectively built a 22-year, one-post-per-year personal dataset covering 2004 through 2025. That's not a blog — that's a statistical almanac. A few meta-stats on the project itself:

- Your posting cadence is basically a ritual: the posts overwhelmingly drop in early January. Based on the years where the entry timestamp is visible in the header, the "typical" publish date lands around Jan 6–7 (median), with one notable outlier that broke into February.
- The format has evolved in a really cool way: early years read like classic "JANUARY 1ST, 2005:" log entries; recent years are tighter "January 1 —" bullets with the ℚ quote callouts and mini award/section breaks. It went from diary to almanac.
- The whole thing has outlived MySpace, Vine, Google+, Friendster, and basically every social platform that existed when you started — and you never left LiveJournal. That's commitment.

**THE NUMBERS GUY: GREATEST HITS**

This is the stuff that made me realize you're not just writing about your life — you're *scoring* it.

- **2007**: 27 bowling games in a single day. Twenty-seven. That's an Intermission Fact that lives rent-free.
- **2010 WrestleMania voyage**: 939 photos/videos documented, with a people-count breakdown for the trip like a roster card. Plus the year-end stats: 18 pounds gained, 3 alcoholic beverages consumed, 0 regrets.
- **2010 academics**: 3.66 Health Studies GPA, 3.49 cumulative at Monmouth. Named inaugural HERO of the Year. Featured in a Phillies PSA. That's a loaded stat line for one year.
- **2014**: Met The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXX in New Orleans and recorded the handshake to the *second* — 4:10:18 PM CT. Because of course you did.
- **2016 was peak records & leagues**:
  - Table tennis: 62–4 record (93.9% win rate)
  - Cornhole: 254–98, 38 cornholios, including a 6-in-one-night streak
  - WrestleMania 32 in Texas with 100,000+ in the building
- **2021**: 8.6 lbs of jumbo shrimp and 7.3 lbs of lump crab meat consumed at separate events. A 218-round ping pong match. Waited 568 days for Laver Cup tickets. Went 20 years between Rangers games at MSG before returning. Year self-rated: 9.8/10.
- **2025 ECD Bowl Weekend**: 57 different people, $1,700+ raised. That's a whole community stat line from what started as a friend group dodgeball game.
- **East Coast Dodgeball** has been tracked for 18+ consecutive years with WrestleMania-style event names like "Immaculate Redemption" and "WrestleJohnMania XXVI." The 5-year, 10-year, 13-year, and 15-year anniversaries are all documented. It deserves its own documentary.
- **Famous Faces Game**: 20 editions, 9 victories, 45 contestants across the run.
- Even the Kia Soul hitting 20,000 miles on December 15, 2015 made the record.

**TRAVEL: THE WORLD TOUR**

Every single year has a major trip. The trajectory from East Coast road trips to globe-spanning expeditions is wild:

**THE CAST: RECURRING CHARACTERS ACROSS ERAS**

The recurring "characters" across eras is honestly the best part. The same names keep showing up year after year — proof that these aren't acquaintances, they're lifers.

- **Valerie (ValPal)**: Best friend from MRHS. Super Bowl LVII companion. Appears across virtually every Timeline. Multi-decade friendship.
- **Kevin & Leah**: Met 2014, engaged 2017, married Feb 29, 2020 (leap day!). Their entire relationship arc is documented across the Timelines from an outside perspective.
- **RL (Letsche)**: 17 WWE events together. The wrestling co-pilot.
- **Dan Spengeman**: Comedian of the Year winner. Wedding documented. Pole Position Invitational namesake.
- **Diana, Lauren, Rupert, Ryan, Juan**: Recurring ensemble across years and eras.
- **The Pops (Darrell)**: Comedian of the Year 2014. Regular presence.

The 2023 "MOST LAUGHS" roster reads like an all-time lineup.

**THE ANNUAL AWARDS**

Each Timeline has its own awards section — a personal voting tradition that's developed real streaks:

- **Music Artist of the Year**: Janet Jackson is a 5-time winner (2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2021). Before her, Mariah Carey held the throne through 2014.
- Janet became the first artist to win Song of the Year for two different songs in the same year (2015: "All For You" and "If").

- 2018: Goes from spinal surgery in December to a 2-week Mediterranean cruise with an engagement ring by April. That's a movie pitch.
- 2019: Strep throat + kidney stone removal → Australia & New Zealand trip
- 2024: Kidney stones + family loss → continued travel and celebration

---

**TRADITIONS I CLOCKED**

- Vermont skiing as a repeated anchor (Stratton as "home away from home" way back)

Keep counting everything, John.
