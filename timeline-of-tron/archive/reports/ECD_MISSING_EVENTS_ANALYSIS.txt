  - Potential additional events: 200


RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DATA EXPANSION
================================================================================

1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
   
   a) Extract post titles from 2015-2025 content
      Location: /db/raw_ecd_posts/ files 124449-162098
      Count: Approximately 100+ posts to process
      
   b) Parse "undated" posts for event information
      Method: Analyze body text for event names, dates, and details
      Expected yield: 100+ events
      
   c) Extract event details from posts:
      - Event dates and years
      - Attendance numbers
      - Match results
      - Award information
      - Fundraiser amounts
      
2. DATA ENRICHMENT:
   
   a) Create mappings between post titles and actual event names
   b) Extract dates from post body when title doesn't contain date
   c) Link related posts to single event records (e.g., multiple 2025 ProBowl posts)
   d) Extract attendance and other metrics from post content

3. VALIDATION:
   
   a) Cross-reference with ATOM feed data for 2024-2025
   b) Verify anniversary celebrations (15YA, 16YA, 17YA, 18YA, 20YA)
   c) Confirm event numbering (Dodgeball series appears to continue)
