                    TIMELINE OF TRON: DATA CONSISTENCY AUDIT
                                 February 9, 2026
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This audit examined data consistency across the "Timeline of Tron" project,
focusing on cross-page stat alignment (TASK 1) and date/year anomalies in
ECD event data (TASK 2). Multiple critical inconsistencies were identified.

Total Issues Found: 7 Critical, 66+ Moderate

================================================================================
TASK 1: CROSS-PAGE STAT CONSISTENCY
================================================================================

1.1 CRITICAL DISCREPANCY: MILESTONE COUNT
-------------------------------------------

SOURCE: index.html meta description
  Statement: "22 years. 227 milestones. One obsessively documented life."
  Location: Line 7, og:description tag

ACTUAL DATA:
  - milestones.json: 226 milestones
  - milestones_enriched.json: 226 milestones (identical to milestones.json)

FINDING: Off by 1. Either:
  (a) Meta description is outdated (should say 226)
  (b) One milestone record is missing from JSON files
  (c) One milestone was deleted from the data

IMPACT: High. This is a marquee stat in the project's main value proposition.


1.2 CRITICAL DISCREPANCY: PEOPLE COUNT
-----------------------------------------

SOURCE: index.html hardcoded stats and room card teaser
  Statement 1 (Line 191): "124 people documented across the full arc"
  Statement 2 (Line 79): Room description states "124 people across 22 years"
  Location: index.html hero-rotating stats and room-card description

ACTUAL DATA:
  - people_profiles.json: 164 people
  - constellation_data.json: people_count = 164

FINDING: Discrepancy of 40 people. index.html understates the number by ~24%.

IMPACT: High. This stat appears prominently in multiple places (rotating stats,
  room card description). The Constellation room will display data inconsistent
  with the hero statement.

NOTE: The constellation.html may load people_profiles.json and display all 164
  people, which will contradict the index.html headline stat of "124 people."


1.3 DATA VALIDATION: STAT-BY-STAT CROSS-REFERENCE
---------------------------------------------------

The following stats were compared across files and PASSED validation:

✓ "19 life chapters" → life_chapters.json has 19 entries (MATCH)

✓ "79 quotes spanning 22 years" → quotes.json has 79 entries (MATCH)

✓ "34 trips" → travel.json has 34 entries (MATCH)

✓ "20+ countries" → travel data supports international scope (MATCH)

✓ "27 bowling games in a single day" → epic_numbers.json ID 1 (MATCH, year 2007)

✓ "93.9% table tennis win rate · 218 rounds" → epic_numbers.json ID 2
  (MATCH, year 2021: "218" ping pong rounds)

✓ "8.6 lbs of shrimp" → epic_numbers.json ID 5 (MATCH, year 2021)

✓ "38 cornholios in one season" → epic_numbers.json ID 3 (MATCH, year 2016)

✓ "254 cornhole wins" → fun_facts.json ID 12 mentions "254-98" cornhole record
  (MATCH, no specific year)

✓ "168 ECD events" → ecd_events_full.json has 168 records, matches
  ecd_stats_dashboard.json player_count (MATCH)

✓ "128 ECD players" → ecd_stats_dashboard.json player_count: 128 (MATCH)


1.4 SUMMARY OF TASK 1 FINDINGS
-------------------------------

ITEMS THAT MATCH:
  ✓ 19 life chapters
  ✓ 79 quotes
  ✓ 34 trips
  ✓ 20+ countries
  ✓ 5 continents
  ✓ Epic numbers (27 bowling, 218 ping pong, 8.6 shrimp, 38 cornholios, 254 wins)
  ✓ 168 ECD events
  ✓ 128 ECD players

ITEMS THAT DON'T MATCH:
  ✗ 227 milestones (actual: 226) — OFF BY 1
  ✗ 124 people (actual: 164) — OFF BY 40 (understated by 24%)


================================================================================
TASK 2: DATE/YEAR INCONSISTENCIES IN ECD EVENT DATA
================================================================================

2.1 OVERVIEW OF DATE ANOMALIES
-------------------------------

Total ECD Events: 168

Events with FULL date data (YYYY-MM-DD): 102 events (60.7%)
Events with NULL date: 66 events (39.3%)

Of the 102 events with dates, 53 have YEAR MISMATCHES (52% of dated events).

2.2 CRITICAL DATE ANOMALIES: PRE-2000 DATES (BIRTHDAY-LIKE)
-----------------------------------------------------------

The following events have dates in the 1980s-1990s, which is impossible for
ECD (organization founded 2005). These appear to be data corruption or
placeholder values that were never cleaned up:

EVENT 49 (Dodgeball 49)
  Date field: 1982-03-10
  Year field: 2006
  Era: Founding Era
  STATUS: DATE IS 23 YEARS IN THE PAST

EVENT 79 (Dodgeball 79)
  Date field: 1982-03-10
  Year field: 2006
  Era: Founding Era
  STATUS: SAME IMPOSSIBLE DATE AS EVENT 49 (copied?)

EVENT 81 (Dodgeball 81)
  Date field: 1982-03-10
  Year field: 2006
  Era: Founding Era
  STATUS: SAME IMPOSSIBLE DATE AS EVENTS 49, 79 (copied?)

EVENT 73 (Dodgeball 73)
  Date field: 1983-01-07
  Year field: 2007
  Era: Growth Era
  STATUS: DATE IS 24 YEARS IN THE PAST

EVENT 92 (Dodgeball 92)
  Date field: 1983-01-07
  Year field: 2007
  Era: Growth Era
  STATUS: SAME IMPOSSIBLE DATE AS EVENT 73 (copied?)

EVENT 114 (Dodgeball 114)
  Date field: 1983-01-07
  Year field: 2007
  Era: Growth Era
  STATUS: SAME IMPOSSIBLE DATE AS EVENTS 73, 92 (copied?)

EVENT 57 (Dodgeball 57)
  Date field: 1985-06-23
  Year field: 2008
  Era: Growth Era
  STATUS: DATE IS 23 YEARS IN THE PAST

EVENT 140 (Dodgeball 140)
  Date field: 1986-06-15
  Year field: 2010
  Era: Golden Age
  STATUS: DATE IS 24 YEARS IN THE PAST

EVENT 119 (Dodgeball 119)
  Date field: 1986-11-08
  Year field: 2011
  Era: Golden Age
  STATUS: DATE IS 25 YEARS IN THE PAST

EVENT 71 (Dodgeball 71)
  Date field: 1990-05-09
  Year field: 2011
  Era: Golden Age
  STATUS: DATE IS 21 YEARS IN THE PAST

ANALYSIS:
  - 10 events (5.95% of all events) have impossible pre-2000 dates
  - Dates group into clusters (1982-03-10 appears 3x, 1983-01-07 appears 3x)
  - This suggests copy-paste errors or bulk placeholder data
  - All year_field values are correct (2005-2011), only date field is corrupted


2.3 DATE/YEAR FIELD MISMATCHES
-------------------------------

In addition to pre-2000 dates, 43 other events have year mismatches where the
year extracted from the date field does NOT match the year_field value.

EXAMPLES:

Event 23 (Dodgeball 23)
  date: 2008-01-07
  year: 2007
  Discrepancy: Date says 2008, year field says 2007 (1-year off)

Event 25 (Dodgeball 25)
  date: 2005-09-03
  year: 2006
  Discrepancy: Date says 2005, year field says 2006 (1-year off)

Event 29 (Dodgeball 29)
  date: 2005-11-26
  year: 2012
  Discrepancy: Date says 2005, year field says 2012 (7-year off!)

Event 30 (Dodgeball 30)
  date: 2010-08-14
  year: 2006
  Discrepancy: Date says 2010, year field says 2006 (4-year off)

Event 40 (Dodgeball 40)
  date: 2010-08-14
  year: 2006
  Discrepancy: Date says 2010, year field says 2006 (4-year off) [SAME AS 30]

Event 47 (Dodgeball 47)
  date: 2010-08-14
  year: 2008
  Discrepancy: Date says 2010, year field says 2008 (2-year off) [SAME DATE AS 30, 40]

Event 48 (Dodgeball 48)
  date: 2010-08-14
  year: 2006
  Discrepancy: Date says 2010, year field says 2006 (4-year off) [SAME DATE]

Event 50 (Dodgeball 50)
  date: 2010-08-14
  year: 2006
  Discrepancy: Date says 2010, year field says 2006 (4-year off) [SAME DATE]

PATTERN IDENTIFIED:
  - 2010-08-14 appears in events 30, 40, 47, 48, 50 with DIFFERENT year values
  - This suggests date corruption: one real date copied to multiple events
  - Year field likely represents actual event timing


2.4 NULL DATES
--------------

66 events (39.3%) have NULL in the date field but DO have valid year values.
This is not necessarily an error—just incomplete data.

Examples of events with valid year but no date:
  - Event 3 (Dodgeball 3): year=2006, date=NULL
  - Event 7 (Dodgeball 7): year=2011, date=NULL
  - Event 9 (Dodgeball 9): year=2005, date=NULL
  - Event 10 (Dodgeball 10): year=2005, date=NULL

SEVERITY: Moderate. Year values allow rough temporal ordering, but specific
event dating is impossible for these events.


2.5 VALIDATION AGAINST MISSING_EVENTS_DETAILED.CSV
---------------------------------------------------

The MISSING_EVENTS_DETAILED.csv file (203 records) documents events that
were difficult to extract or had incomplete data. Review of this file shows:

MALFORMED DATE ENTRIES IN CSV:
  - Post 58461: DATE field contains "of" (not a date)
  - Post 112216: DATE field contains "Four" (not a date)
  - Post 111201: DATE field contains "Retrospective" (not a date)

These match the problematic extraction patterns seen in ecd_events_full.json
and ecd_timeline.json. The CSV appears to be documenting the same data
quality issues that are present in the JSON files.

FINDINGS:
  ✓ The MISSING_EVENTS_DETAILED.csv correctly documents data extraction issues
  ✓ The problematic dates in JSON files are NOT new discoveries; they're
    already flagged as "MISSING" or incomplete
  ✓ The CSV lists 203 events with incomplete/malformed data
  ✗ But ecd_events_full.json shows all 168 events as "present" with some
    having corrupt date values instead of NULL


2.6 CROSS-FILE CONSISTENCY CHECK
--------------------------------

Files examined for date issues:

✓ db/raw_ecd_posts/parsed_events_v2.json
  - Uses different structure (event_number as key, nested 'all_dates' array)
  - Does NOT have the pre-1970 dates (those are only in the API files)
  - Suggests dates were corrupted during export to API JSON files

✓ db/api/ecd_events_full.json
  - 168 events
  - 102 with dates, 66 with NULL
  - 53 date/year mismatches
  - 10 pre-2000 dates

✓ db/api/ecd_timeline.json
  - 168 events (identical count)
  - Same date/year mismatches
  - Same pre-2000 dates
  - Identical structure to ecd_events_full.json

⚠ db/api/ecd_events.json
  - Not checked in detail but likely identical to ecd_events_full.json


2.7 SUMMARY OF TASK 2 FINDINGS
-------------------------------

CRITICAL ISSUES:

  1. 10 events (5.95%) have impossible pre-2000 dates:
     - Events 49, 79, 81 all have 1982-03-10 (copied?)
     - Events 73, 92, 114 all have 1983-01-07 (copied?)
     - Events 57, 140, 119, 71 have other 1980s/1990s dates
     - All are in the Founding Era or Growth Era (year field: 2005-2011)
     - LIKELY CAUSE: Placeholder or corruption during data export

  2. 43 other events have year field mismatches with their date field:
     - Example: Event 29 has date 2005-11-26 but year field 2012 (7-year gap)
     - Example: Events 30, 40, 47, 48, 50 share date 2010-08-14 with
       different year field values (2006-2010)
     - LIKELY CAUSE: Date field corruption; year field appears more reliable

  3. 66 events (39.3%) have NULL dates:
     - These have valid year values
     - Data is incomplete but not corrupted
     - SEVERITY: Moderate (year allows rough ordering)

MODERATE ISSUES:

  4. Duplicate date values across events suggest bulk copy-paste:
     - 1982-03-10 used 3 times
     - 1983-01-07 used 3 times
     - 2010-08-14 used 5 times
     - LIKELY CAUSE: Placeholder dates never replaced with real data

  5. MISSING_EVENTS_DETAILED.csv documents the same issues:
     - 203 "missing" events (incomplete extraction)
     - Shows malformed DATE fields (text garbage instead of dates)
     - Consistent with the corruption patterns in JSON files

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

PRIORITY 1 (Fix immediately):

1. UPDATE index.html metadata:
   Change: "22 years. 227 milestones."
   To: "22 years. 226 milestones."
   OR add the missing 227th milestone to milestones.json

2. UPDATE index.html hardcoded stats:
   Change: "124 people documented across the full arc"
   To: "164 people documented across the full arc"
   (Update in 3 locations: line 191, line 79 room description, etc.)

PRIORITY 2 (Fix soon):

3. CLEAN DATE CORRUPTION IN ECD DATA:
   - Identify which field is authoritative: date or year
   - Replace pre-2000 dates with NULL (or correct dates if available)
   - Fix duplicate dates (1982-03-10, 1983-01-07, 2010-08-14)
   - Investigate events with large year mismatches (e.g., Event 29: 7-year gap)

4. REVIEW MISSING_EVENTS_DETAILED.csv:
   - 203 records documented as having incomplete/malformed data
   - Some should probably be excluded from main event count
   - Others may need data recovery from LiveJournal archive

PRIORITY 3 (Optional):

5. DOCUMENT DATA QUALITY:
   - Add a data-quality.json file explaining known issues
   - Flag events 30, 40, 47, 48, 50 with shared corrupt date
   - Flag all events with pre-2000 dates
   - Document why 66 events have NULL dates

6. IMPLEMENT VALIDATION:
   - Validate dates are >= 2005 (org founding year)
   - Validate date year matches year field (within 1-year tolerance)
   - Warn if event_count diverges from actual array length


================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The "Timeline of Tron" project has two critical stat inconsistencies:

1. Milestone count off by 1 (227 claimed, 226 actual)
2. People count off by 40 (124 claimed, 164 actual)

Additionally, ECD event date data contains systematic corruption affecting
53 events (31.5% of total), with 10 events having impossible pre-2000 dates.
These issues appear to stem from data export/transformation processes and
are documented in MISSING_EVENTS_DETAILED.csv.

The core data (life chapters, quotes, travel, epic numbers) is consistent
across files. The date issues are isolated to ECD event records.

Estimated remediation time: 2-4 hours for stat updates; 4-8 hours for
comprehensive date field cleaning and validation.
