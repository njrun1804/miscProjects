BEYOND #200:
  Events #202, #203, #218 mentioned (appears to be player numbers or future refs)


CRITICAL FINDINGS:
================================================================================

1. POST #114290 IS CRUCIAL
   - Title: "One Day To Stop This WORLD"
   - Contains timeline with specific dates for events #172, #173, #182
   - Appears to be comprehensive historical post
   - MUST BE REVIEWED for missing event details

2. EARLY EVENTS ARE WELL-DOCUMENTED
   - Events #4-6, #11-12 have 80-280 mentions each
   - These are foundational dodgeball events
   - Multiple appearances in lists, statistics, and references

3. ROMAN NUMERAL FORMAT DISCOVERED
   - Events #190-191 use Roman numeral format
   - Suggests events 190-199 may use DODGEBALL CXC through DODGEBALL CXCIX
   - This formatting may explain some "missing" events

4. 19 EVENTS HAVE ZERO DOCUMENTATION
   - 111, 112, 152, 175-189, 193-198 not mentioned anywhere
   - Either non-existent, future events, or different source needed
   - May need to check comments section or HTML body
