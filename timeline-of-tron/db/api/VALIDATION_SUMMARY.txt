================================================================================
RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (P1) - Do Before Production Use:
────────────────────────────────────────
1. De-duplicate match_results table
   Impact: Affects 20-30% of match records (99 total)
   Effort: Low
   SQL Template:
     SELECT winner, loser, post_date, COUNT(*) as cnt 
     FROM ecd_match_results 
     GROUP BY winner, loser, post_date 
     HAVING cnt > 1
   
2. Normalize player names in awards & rivalries
   Impact: 12-71 entities need standardization
   Tools: Use existing name_aliases.json + name_resolver.py
   Effort: Medium
   
3. Resolve 2 missing match players
   Details: Diana Dibuccio, Bobby Brown
   Investigation: Check if variations of existing players
   Effort: Low

SHORT-TERM (P2) - Do Soon:
──────────────────────────
4. Fix null post titles (2 posts)
   Post IDs: 113288, 119226
   Effort: Very Low

5. Clean award recipient parsing
   Impact: 12 of 27 awards have invalid recipients
   Effort: Medium
   Note: Some entries like "$1,720 For LAUREN & EMMA" are not player names

ONGOING (P3) - Good to Have:
────────────────────────────
6. Create data quality dashboard
   Track: Referential integrity %, duplicate rate, null field counts
   Effort: High
   Value: Proactive monitoring of data issues

7. Document data quirks
   Record: Known parsing issues, name variations, edge cases
   Effort: Low
   Value: Future developer understanding
