Her first challenger, much like herself prior to DODGEBALL 46, has never won a captains battle.\nJust the name alone turns heads. Derek Carty is one of the most athletically-gifted competitors ever, and to some, it may come as a surprise that he has yet to win as a captain. You can bet he looks to turn that very bad luck into something very positive.\nAs DODGEBALL 50 approaches, it will always be in question who the rival captains will be come that August 4th night. Two challengers have already been named for the forthcoming events; Kevin Adams at DODGEBALL 48, and John Tronolone at DODGEBALL 49.\n- Who will go into DODGEBALL 50 as the reigning champion?\nIt's all between Sara DeCuir, Derek Carty, Kevin Adams, and John Tronolone. After DODGEBALL 47, scratch off one of them from the list.\nDODGEBALL 50: Wall High School vs. Ocean Road Park\nDODGEBALL 50, easily the biggest one of them all, is scheduled to take place at its birthplace, Ocean Road Park. However, many in the dodgeball world have spoke up against the idea for the mere fact that past ORP events have been poor (as well possible equipment loss).\nThis has certainly brought up mixed feelings from a good number of players, more so the regulars. What will be done in the coming weeks is a simple vote to decide once and for all where DODGEBALL 50 will emanate.\nDODGEBALL 50 is Friday, August 4th.
