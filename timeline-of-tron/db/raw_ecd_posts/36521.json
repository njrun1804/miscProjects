DODGEBALL 50 certainly set new standards and added more fun to an already incredible journey.\nKevin Adams: The Reign Continues!\nAlready, Season 6 will kick off with a bang as reigning singles champ Kevin Adams will defend the coveted Captains Championship. Having won the title from Sara DeCuir at DODGEBALL 48, he then went on to defeat another legend in John Tronolone to retain at DODGEBALL 49. From there at DODGEBALL 50, he was one of four players, oddly enough with all three of his brothers, in the first-ever \"2 vs. 2\" captains battle, in which he and iconic brother Steve came out victorious.\nSo after three incredible victories for the young, crafty veteran, his next challenger has yet to be decided. Of course that will change come August the 12th: the second elimination-style Rimshot Contest will take place! All hopefuls be prepared; the winner could be you!\nAlso, DODGEBALL 51 is the official debut of stables!
