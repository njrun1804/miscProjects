  "body_text": "DODGEBALL LX has arrived and there is no turning back! Here is the final preview heading into the spectacle known as DODGEBALL LX ...\nDODGEBALL LX Music\nShe's bringing it back is the youngest Nogueira sister ... the iPod! Kathryn Nogueira isn't a female titan for just any reason. The dedication for a game she herself rarely partakes in is unmatched. Thanks to her, music will be provided throughout the entire night via her very own iPod.\nDODGEBALL LX Pageantry\nExpect a bright look at DODGEBALL LX. Several players will be volunteering a little of their time before hand to help set-up the court for what should be one of the greatest displays at any dodgeball event. It's a sight combatants will have to wait and see.\nDODGEBALL LX Awards\nThe awards have been finalized and before the action even gets under way, they will be presented to those deserving recipients. Categories already announced include the returning \"Prodigy Award\" as well the \"Act of Courage\" Award. As a bonus for simply reading the dodgeball website, another category has been released: the famed \"Powerhouse Thrower\" Award.\nDODGEBALL LX Captains\nWhat a rare happening already set for DODGEBALL LX. It's a 2-on-2 attraction for team pride and glory. This will certainly be a unique situation as like DODGEBALL 50, no one will know which players have formed an alliance. On top of that, who the winners will be is perhaps the bigger question.\nDODGEBALL LX Extras\nYou just never know what's going to happen at these anticipated ten-events. Waterballoons, water guns, new stars, celebratory cakes, and even longtime returns have truly turned these season finales into the premiere events. It's a once in a lifetime event, so don't miss out!",
