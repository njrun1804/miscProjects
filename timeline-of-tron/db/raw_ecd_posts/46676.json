  "body_text": "No string of events have followed the same patterns as the past three; LXIV, LXV, and most recently 66. Somehow, someway, the outcome of each has been positive whether the events ended with high octane action or an on-court pizza party thanks to Luke.\nThe main concern without question regards the tennis lights. Though play hasn't ceased, still no one has found any information for their failure. It's safe to say however, and the past events proves this, that dodgeball is not going anywhere for the time being. DODGEBALL 66 specifically was a prime example that all you need is dedication [and a little luck]. 66 ended at 10:56pm; the latest of the most recent\nDark Dodgeball\nshowdowns.\nHere is what the world could expect at the 67th dodgeball extravanganza:\n-- First-time captains? (Currently 3 weeks running)\n-- Lights out? (Currently 3 weeks running)\n-- Front Courts / Trash Cans (Currently 3 weeks running)\n-- The debut of 2 new stars? (Currently 3 weeks running)\n-- Pond Scum Challenge haulted? (Currently 3 weeks running)\n-- Pizza Party? (Currently 4 weeks running)\nThat's consistency at its best. Don't forget to add the intense and wild action of dodgeball itself; faceshots, nutshots, rivalries, and more! There's a reason it's lasted for over a year.\nMAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT!!!\nIn an effort to spark some fire into upcoming events, the following captains matches have been announced*:\nDODGEBALL 69 ...\nValerie Winston vs. Lauren Winston III\n(December 23rd, 2006)\nDODGEBALL 70 ...\nKevin Megill vs. Chris Adams\n: \"Legend vs. Legend\" (December 30th, 2006)\n*Subject to change",
