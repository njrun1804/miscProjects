Due to Easter, two dates have been changed:\nSaturday, 03/25/06 ~ DODGEBALL 32\nSaturday, 04/01/06 ~ DODGEBALL 33\n>> Friday, 04/07/06 ~ DODGEBALL 34 (Wall High School with normal 7PM Start Time)\n>> Sunday, 04/09/06 ~ DODGEBALL 35 (Ocean Road Park with 3PM Start Time)\nFor the first time since DODGEBALL 18 and DODGEBALL 19 in mid-December, there will be an [untraditional] \"Double Header\". Similar to Christmas, we'll take two weeks off. DODGEBALL 36 will take place the weekend following Easter.\n________________________________________\n____________________________\nStarting off with the records:\n> Attendance: 12 (Lowest ever along with DODGEBALL DAY 1)\n> Biggest Return: Justin Pierce (Last Played at DODGEBALL 27)\n> New Players: None (Third time ever following XXIV and TWENTY-SIX)\n> Due to the low turnout, there were no captains for DODGEBALL XXX-ONE; a first since DODGEBALL XTWO.\n> The brothers Adams have terrorized the court since the very inception. Since Chris's debut at DODGEBALL DAY 3, at least two of the brothers have played at every single event. At XXX-ONE, that streak was broken when Chris was the only brother to play.\n> XXX-ONE marked the first time the main game went from the traditional game of dodgeball to a new type known as \"Prison Ball\".\n> XXX-ONE was the final winter dodgeball.\n> As XXX-ONE came to a close, the third verbal \"invasion\" in history took place. From the looks of it, allies of the apparent Ocean Township High School students back at DODGEBALL XXIV were at it again. They were turned back however when Lauren Freda called the local police, sending the cowards back to where they came from.\n________________________________________\n____________________________\nXXX-ONE seemed to have set new standards in the game of dodgeball. The record-breaking low attendance allowed for a new type of match-up, eliminating many of the game's norms. \"Prison Ball\" had arrived and there was no turning back.\nThe teams themselves had no leading captains. But the way teams were set up were simply a division of bodies before dodgeball were to happen.\nTEAM ONE\nJustin Pierce\nRobert Brown\nChris Adams\nLenny Herrera\nMike \"Sputz\"\n*Kevin Megill\nTEAM TWO\nValerie Winston\nDan Spengeman\nDiana DiBuccio\nJohn Tronolone\nLauren Winston\n*Zach Katz\n*Joined later in the evening*\nOn paper, this certainly looked as a mismatch. On the court, that was proven true. Team TWO did everything in their power to withstand the onslaught of rifled dodgeballs, but to no avail, Team ONE was just that much more powerful.\nDespite what seemed true on paper, it was valiant effort in a match that was jokingly viewed as \"Girls\" vs. Guys.\nThe \"Girls\" (Team TWO) somehow snuck in three victories before the night was over. The Guys led the whole night however, concluding with six.\n........\nZach Katz's emergence helped significantly, evening out the teams a little bit better. He caught numerous times and jumped as high as possible to bring himself back into the game. The same can also be said for \"Quick Sand\" Dan Spengeman.\nKevin Megill made his presence felt, especially with a \"pain\" ball in hand. His arm is never to be looked past; when it came time to throw, he delivered.\nJustin Pierce seemed to bring more of a mental game, which did indeed work. When imprisoned, he stood \"far\" in the corner, allowing for less difficult tosses by fellow teammates.\n________________________________________\n____________________________\nWhere does dodgeball go from here? That's an easy question; DODGEBALL 32.\nIt seems with the smaller turnouts, more types of dodgeball come out of the woodworks. The aftermath of DODGEBALL 20 is a perfect example: \"Speed\" Ball anyone?\nDODGEBALL XXX-ONE is done and over with, but surely never forgotten. \"Prison Ball\" added new excitement to an already exciting game.\nThe weeks to come are looking quite interesting. Expect some major returns. You never know who is going to show up ... that's just part of the fun.\nMarch 25th ... 7PM ... Wall High School ... DODGEBALL 32.",
