Since that day, he has been on a hot streak, defeating legend after legend in succession.\nEarlier in the week, it was supposedly \"revealed\" that one Sara DeCuir would be the challenger for the captains crown against the man she lost it to, Kevin himself. However, Kevin Adams vs. Sara DeCuir II is not the scheduled match-up at DODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO.\n......\n-- In the midst of Season V, one man stepped up wanting a crack at the gold. Having reserved the challenger's position at DODGEBALL 51, he was unable to attend the event, forcing the rimshot contest. That one man is Pond Scum icon, Ray Marzarella.\nRay debuted some 26 events ago at February's DODGEBALL XXV. On that night, he and Pond Scum ally Gerald \"G-Money\" Lewis were chosen as the night's captains, despite knowing not one person on the court. Ray would go on to defeat Gerald on that fateful evening, an accomplishment of great heights.\nBut \"Ray-Ray\" has not been in the captains circle since, and his 1 and 0 record has remained untouched. Come DODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO, things will change for Ray, and more so Pond Scum as a whole. Ray will do battle with one Kevin Adams this coming Saturday. But for some reason if Ray is again unable to attend, there will be a suitable replacement ...\n-- When you think of Pond Scum, three names come to mind; Ray, Gerald, and perhaps the most controversial, \"Tenacious\" Dan Turner.\nDan was the third Pond Scum member to burst on to the dodgeball scene. Since his debut at the populated DODGEBALL XXVIII, it is no secret that his skills are above and beyond many of his peers.\nMost recently at DODGEBALL 50, he was in a heated battle with several opposing team members. After back and forth bickering, Dan stood tall as his enemies had failed to eliminate him as the event reached its end.\nA man perhaps best known for his dodging ability, and more so trash talking ability, Dan Turner has never lead a team into battle. In Ray's absence, he will get that chance.\nThis is what the captain's match looks like for DODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO:\nChampionship Match\nRay Marzarella vs. Kevin Adams (Champion)\n-OR-\nChampionship Match\nDan Turner vs. Kevin Adams (Champion)\nWill Pond Scum take claim to the thrown?\n________________________________________\n______\nDODGEBALL 54 / OYA News!\nIt was previously reported that DODGEBALL 54, also known as the One Year Anniversary, will consist of nothing but painballs and foam footballs.
