  "body_text": "... September 3, 2005 ... the first [impromtu] dodgeball extravaganza occured, creating enduring rivalries and solidfying brotherhood. Since DAY 1, dodgeball remained a weekly tradition, one full of the moments all long to keep; nutshots, ten-events, \"Wet Wars\", broken fingers, and so much more have been experienced in the course of one year plus. There was room for only one more event of 2006 and what better way to go out than with a classic ten-event. Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the show ... Welcome to DODGEBALL 70 ...\nIt was perhaps the most anticipated match in history, one that did not disappoint. Two of the league's biggest icons met one-on-one in a traditional captains confrontation, and there wasn\u2019t a better place for it to happen than at the final event of the year, DODGEBALL 70!\nChris Adams and Kevin Fitzpatrick have earned their stripes through hard work, consistency, and an overall passion and drive like no other. Which megastar would crack under pressure as the world feasted their eyes on the biggest match of the year?\nTraditional Rules\nAll one could say was \"Wow\". It was a match that, on paper, could have swung either way \u2026\nDominant\n: a one word description of Team FITZ. From the agile Mike Edwards and Mike Butler to the powerful Kevin Megill and \"Fitz\" himself, the array of talent on the team proved to be too much for Team CHRIS. Team CHRIS went winless in the first six games of DODGEBALL 70. Would the introduction of Prison Ball affect the outcome?\nPrison Ball Rules\nNo captain could have possibly mounted a counter-attack of this size, let alone someone the caliber of Chris Adams. Though Games 8 and 9 went to Team CHRIS, it was obvious the end result of this memorable match belonged to the one and only Kevin Fitzpatrick.\nMuch credit is deserved to Team CHRIS, and Adams himself, for never backing down. They all fought to the very end.\nLegend vs. Legend\n... Kevin Fitzpatrick defeated Chris Adams at DODGEBALL 70: 7 \u2013 2.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nMUSIC\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nAlongside the theme song \"Ladies and Gentlemen\", players and spectators alike were treated to a variety of music, something that hasn\u2019t been true of past events.\n\"Suck My Kiss\" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden\u2019s \"Outshined\", and \"Legs\" by ZZ Top were thrown into one giant collection with dance hits like Bizarre Inc.\u2019s \"Gonna Get You\", \"Let me Clear My Throat\" by DJ Kool, and Technotronic\u2019s \"Move This\".\nFilter, Will Smith, 311, Nonpoint, Sugar Ray, Jay Z, among other popular artists and bands made for one huge compilation, one everyone was to enjoy.\nThere has been nothing but positive reviews in regards to the music treatment at DODGEBALL 70. And though it\u2019s a bit soon, a DODGEBALL 80 playlist is already in the works.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nMOMENTS\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nJim Martin getting duct-taped at DODGEBALL 20, DODGEBALL 50\u2019s water balloon fight, DODGEBALL LX\u2019s decorative trash can set up ... there is always a list of memorable moments one can expect at a ten-event.\n- The pre-game featuring some of dodgeball\u2019s newest participants.\n- Christmas lights hanging from the tennis poles as well as the 10 large table cloths on the fence.\n- Kevin Fitzpatrick\u2019s \"Break Dance\" dodge in the early goings of 70.\n- Lauren Stopa\u2019s ecstatic reaction to hearing the 1996 dance hit \"Be My Lover\" by La Bouche.\n- Justin Pierce remaining in a game for an extended period of time, sitting at the frontline.\n- Diana DiBuccio wearing reindeer antlers and a Santa hat during gameplay. Her loud yells of \"Martha\" were also rather comical.\n- Kevin Megill\u2019s \"White Man Dance\" as well as his singing all night long.\n- The friendly police officer that stopped to see the action up close and personal. According to a few players, he plans on talking with a maintenance and grounds representative in regards to the large tennis lights.\n- John Tronolone finally getting eliminated for the first time in Game 8 after a series of eliminations in the same game.\n- Kevin Adams on the receiving end of a vicious nutshot thanks to Kevin Megill.\n- The fun of being on tape, with hilarious clips from Mike \"Sputz\", Chris Adams, and more.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nRECORDS\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n- The attendance was 32.\n- There were two \"Biggest Returns\": Robert Brown and Matt Brown, who both last appeared at DODGEBALL LX.\n- DODGEBALL 70 witnessed the debut of 8 new stars: Josh Snell, Jeff Heimbuch, Ali Gleason, Mike Sosinski, Heather Gillespie, Justin Stack, Jesse Eisenmann, and Mike Scardillo. DODGEBALL 70 tied the record for the most number of new players at a ten-event. DODGEBALL 50 also featured 8 debuting competitors.\n- DODGEBALL 70 fell on the one year anniversary of DODGEBALL 20.\n- The theme song was Saliva\u2019s \"Ladies and Gentleman\".\n- Ten-event classics: sign-in sheet, video footage, decorations with popular inclusion of Christmas lights, pictures taken via digital camera, and music provided by an iPod.\n- DODGEBALL 70 broke the \"Ten-Event Pattern\" in regards to venue. X, 30, and 50 were all at Ocean Road Park. 20, XL, and LX were at Wall High School. If the pattern were to have continued, DODGEBALL 70 should have emanated from ORP.\n- DODGEBALL 70 joins DODGEBALL 20 as being the only two ten-events to be played on the front courts of Wall High School.\n- As announced in the final week leading up to DODGEBALL 70, awards were\nnot\ngiven out live, a ten-event first. Instead, they can be seen below:\n>>\nMost Intense Award\n:\nSascha Basista\n>>\nAppreciation Award\n:\nLauren Winston, Kevin Adams\n(Given to those who have contributed on/off the court)\n- As expected, the large tennis lights went off at 8pm. Because of the continuing light failure, DODGEBALL 70 became the first ten-event to feature\nDark Dodgeball\n.\n- A small pre-game battle took place before the main match.\n- The first six games were held under traditional dodgeball rules. Starting with Game 7, Prison Ball rules were in effect.\n- In the\nLegend vs. Legend\nmatch-up, Chris Adams suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Kevin Fitzpatrick. Kevin\u2019s record: 2-1-0. Chris\u2019s record: 3-3-0. This was Chris\u2019s second captains appearance at a ten-event; it was Fitz\u2019s first.\n- In a rare occurance, Kevin Fitzpatrick and John Tronolone collectively earned the first 5 game-winning eliminations. Kevin Megill would score the game winner in Game 6, lastly eliminating Matt Brown.\n- Excluding DODGEBALL 70 new blood, the following competitors made their ten-event debut: Max O\u2019Rielly, Terra Bergquist, Michael Butler, Sascha Basista, and Meredith (Merri) Lewis.\n- Valerie Winston and Dan Spengeman both missed their first ten-event. Kevin Adams and John Tronolone are now the last remaining players to have partaken in all 7 season finale extravaganzas.\n- And for the first time in over a year, three group shots were taken at the conclusion of DODGEBALL 70.\nDODGEBALL 70 Photo Album:\nhttp://community.webshots.com/user/EastCoastDodgeball\n*Only a fraction of DODGEBALL 70 participants are pictured*\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nTHANK YOU!\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nOver a year into the journey and the great game of dodgeball can still pull off an unforgettable night like this.\nAlways\nbelieve the hype.\nThanks are in order to Kevin Adams, Jim Martin, John Tronolone, and Max O'Rielly who set up the many decorations. The music treatment was made possible by Kathryn Nogueira, so special thanks to her as well.\nDODGEBALL 70 was nothing short of successful, and that itself is a complete understatement. Three hours-plus of the hard-hitting action and friendly interaction all have come to love created one final memory of 2006.\nAs always, thanks to everyone who made DODGEBALL 70 the event of the year!",
