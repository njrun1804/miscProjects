  "body_text": "BACKGROUND & PRODUCTION\nECD:10\n, also known as the\n10 Year Anniversary\nand\nX Games\n, will be the 204th\nEast Coast Dodgeball\nevent scheduled for August 22, 2015 at 5:45pm. The host venue is Wall High School which will hold its 179th presentation.\nECD:10\nwill feature one main event and one secondary attraction that both involve members of the past and present roster.\nMAIN EVENT\nECD:10's\nprimary attraction will see\nKevin Megill, Justin Wolf, and Justin Pierce versus Michael Edwards, Juan Londono, and Tom Adams\nin a standard 3-vs-3 captains confrontation. Each of the leading generals were inducted into the\nECDElite\nHall of Fame since its inception at\nECD175\n.\nTHE CAST\nMEGILL\n- #1 ranked player circa ECD 40-60 and remained a constant in the Top 3 until shoulder injury at 175; record 7x \"Excellence Award\" recipient; headlined 30, 80, 95, 130, 166*, 174^, and 198*.\nWOLF\n- ranked in  Top 3 defensive players all-time; 1 of just 4 players to win both Rimshot Contest and Battle Royal during career; headlined events 140, 169*, 190, and 198*.\nPIERCE\n- 1 of only 2 players in ECD history ranked in the Top 10 between events 1-200; 5x (and only) Hit The Human Contest volunteer victim; headlined 3 major events out of a slim 5 total matches\nEDWARDS\n- Top 10 player throughout entire career from ECD 47-200; 2x (most all-time) Championship Chase champion; headlined events 80, 95, 100, 145, and 184^.\nLONDONO\n- ECD's remarkable \"Cinderella Story\"; only player to win\nPick Your Poison, CREAmation Rules, & GodMode Rules\nmatches; headlined events 115, 140, and 150.\nADAMS\n- Top 3 most accurate player and 3rd best overall offense; only player to win \"Main Event Star\" award; headlined events 15, 50, 90, 117*.\n* = Holiday special such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Memorial Day\n^ = August Summer Showdown special attraction\nSELECTION PROCESS & TEAM FORMATION\nThe selection process was finalized after an estimated six month deliberation. About his choice in combatants, behind-the-scenes facilitator, The Writer, explained that none of the\nDODGEBOWL 200\ncaptains were eligible and that \"a new cast should headline this major milestone in an effort to be fair to equally legendary figures.\"\nThe placement of captains into the 3-man co-captained teams was overseen by The Writer, with input from\nECDElitists\nChristoper Adams and Diana DiBuccio. The stakes of the encounter are reported \"sky high.\"\n\"Like most six-person confrontations, the well-documented history of each individual player involved creates, at the minimum, a chance at finality. For instance, take ECD115: the mighty trio of Kevin Fitzpatrick, Ray Marzarella, and Juan Londono clashed with Chris Adams, Sascha Basista, and Rob Avakian in, as the fitting tagline read, 'the war to settle the (tie) scores.' An encounter ten years in the making must meet and certainly exceed the same criteria.\nECD:10\nhas struck more than the imagination could handle.\"\nOPPOSITIONAL CONFLICT\nECD's\nstatisticians have discovered several historical points of interests pertaining to major rivalries of the past -\n\u25ba Megill has defeated every opponent he's ever faced\nexcept\nEdwards; Megill lost at 80 and tied at 95. Should Megill win, he'll be the first and only\nECDElitist\nto beat every challenger placed in front of him.\nECD:10\nwill be Megill's first six-person contest; Edwards, meanwhile, will tie for most-ever having previously co-captained on three separate occasions, winning the first-ever 3-vs-3 at\nECD100\n.\n\u25ba The highly-regarded Londono-Wolf rivalry witnessed matches held at events 140, 142, and 158. Londono holds the comfortable 2-0-1 edge. This will be Wolf's first-ever co-captaincy match, the last of the\nECDElite\nto partake in either a 2-on-2 or 3-on-3. In comparison, Londono has never lost a 3-on-3 contest.\n\u25ba At\nECD90\n, Pierce defeated Adams in an acclaimed battle. The next event, Adams no-showed their scheduled return bout stipulated under\nCREAMation Rules\n. In a 2015 interview, Pierce verbally requested a rematch with Adams stating specifically \"We were supposed to have a\nCREAMation\nbut he never showed up.\"\nECD\nhistory also offers these unique pieces of information -\n\u25ba Pierce and Edwards were victorious co-captains at\nECD100\n, the inaugural six-person encounter in history. Eighty-four events later, they met on opposing sides at the subtitled \"Star Wars\" showdown that ended in a 5-5 draw.\nECD:10\nis their second match against one another.\n\u25ba Megill defeated Londono at\nECD79\n, a record-shattering 17-point margin of victory that still stands today. A Megill triumph at\nECD:10\nwill make him the 6th individual to win the \"triple crown\" of captaincy, that being victories in 1-vs-1, 2-vs-2, and 3-vs-3 matches; Londono was the 2nd to accomplish this feat and completed such in the shortest amount of time at a mere 37 events.\n\u25ba Adams has never won a co-captaincy match, although his only effort was in a 2-on-2 at\nECD50\n. Additionally, Adams has not been a captain since\nECD117\n, the longest drought among the\nECD:10\nheadliners.\n\u25ba Lastly, Londono and Pierce currently hold unbeaten streaks dating back to their origins at events 98 and 90, respectively. Since then, Londono's streak remains the longest in ECD history at 5-0-2; Pierce is 3-0-1.\nALLIANCE BREAKDOWN\n\u25ba Megill, Wolf, Pierce: Despite being teammates, Megill and Wolf have fought twice before, the most recent a 12-3\nCREAMation\nslaughter in favor of Megill. Megill is also a member of Team ALL and will have to co-exist with his WALL counterparts.\n\u25ba Edwards, Londono, Adams: The Londono-Adams feud was nominated for 2007 Rivalry of the Year. Londono would have aligned with Pierce at\nECD91\nto face Adams, but Adams no-showed the event. Adams represents Team WALL while Edwards and Londono comprise a major part of Team ALL.\nThe Writer also noted that \"none of the teammates have ever joined forces together. That is the most important part.\"\nSECONDARY ATTRACTION\nECD:10's\nspecial contest will be the 21st Rimshot Contest coined the\n\"StopaShot Contest\"\n. The bonus mini-game is named in honor of\nECDElite\nHall of Famer, Lauren Stopa, for her years of pinpoint accuracy and championship victory at the 15th Rimshot Contest.\nAll competitors and spectators are eligible to partake. A mystery prize will be awarded to the champion. Admission is free.\nEXTERNAL LINKS\nECD Official Facebook Page\nECD:10\nFacebook Event Page\nECD80: Edwards meets Megill in debut match\nECD90: Pierce vs. T. Adams\nECD91: Pierce vs. T.
