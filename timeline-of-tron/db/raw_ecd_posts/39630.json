  "body_text": "Here's a tribute to all of the women who have changed dodgeball for the better, starting with the first six.\nKATHRYN NOGUEIRA\nShe debuted over a year ago and has brought so much to the table, literally and figuratively. The 47 people in attendance at DODGEBALL 50 can still remember the plates of cookies and rice crispy treats baked by Kathryn herself. Whether it was going on coffee/doughnut runs during the treacherous winter events to printing out every single set of Dodgeball Excellence Awards, Kathryn Nogueira will live among dodgeball's elite females.\nSARA DECUIR\nIntense, athletic, passionate. Those are just three words to describe arguably the most dominant female in history. Sara joined the fray in early-November 2005, making an impactful debut to say the least. She is the only female to win the \"Most Intense Award\" and was inducted into the now-defunct Hall of Fame at DODGEBALL 20. Even some ten months later, Sara DeCuir's career is far from over.\nCHRISTINA GAURINO\nChristina's off-court achievements have allowed for dodgeball to seemingly live forever. The girlfriend of one Dan Spengeman has contributed plenty with efforts in photography and video taping, as well as assisting in the creation of several promotional posters. Though her off-court success may outshine her ahtletic ability, there is no denying her toughness and resiliency. She has been on the receiving end of some of the worst headshots and not once did she quit.\nALISON BERTSCH\nAlison debuted at the first \"Wet War\", DODGEBALL VII, and even then, one could tell she would in fact remain a top star. Through her success, she has earned the \"Powerhouse Thrower\" award, the only female to win the award. Like Sara DeCuir, she remains at the front lines in each game, proving to be a fearless competitor. Alison is living proof that women are just as tough as the men.\nAIMEE SAVOTH\nHere is another star whose outside success has triumphed greater than her physical talent. Along side Kathryn Nogueira, she too baked the delicious goods at the massive DODGEBALL 50, put together hundreds of songs on Kathryn's iPod for the same event, and is a \"ten\" event decoration specialist, arriving early many a time to create an incredible atmosphere. Without Aimee's dedication, dodgeball would be a little less fun.\nLAUREN FREDA\nA multi-time award winner, Lauren Freda's rise to fame came instantly. There was perhaps no one more dominant during Season 1 than she, even defeating Valerie Winston at DODGEBALL 8 in captains competition. Putting their rivalry aside, together they would go on to win the \"Allied Powers\" award at DODGEBALL 30 after weeks of terror and destruction left on the court. She was one of two female HOF inductees at DODGEBALL X, earning a spot into dodgeball immortality.",
