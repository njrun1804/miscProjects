For just the 7th time in\nECD\nhistory - and the first since October 2008 - the dreaded\nECDDraft\nreemerged, splitting the warriors of the famed game into two formidable armies.\nThe draft consisted of 17 total combatants, with three additional - Diana DiBuccio, Justin Pierce, and Juan Londono - added to the mix upon their arrivals during ANNIVERSARY 6.\nAfter the conclusion of Game 5, a secret trade was made which saw Justin Wolf and Chris Burke switch teams; a first-time occurrence for the\nDraft\n.\nThe end result witnessed a crushing 7 to 1 defeat of the second squad [on the bottom]. Never before had an\nECDDraft\nproduced such a massacre.\nSECONDARY CONTEST: The \"MoneyMaker\"\nRimshot Contest\nNewcomer\nKayla Knott\nmade monumental history when she bested 9 top competitors for the coveted\nRimshot Contest\ncrown in her debut event. The array of talent, albeit unsuccessful, was a \"who's who\" list of highly-ranked participants: Kevin Megill, Gary Dietrich, Kenny Jacobs, Melissa Kerr, Joanice Lima, Justin Wolf, former one-time winner John Tronolone, former two-time winner Chris Adams, and defending, one-time champion Lauren Stopa.\nThis was the 16th overall\nRimshot Contest\n, and the 3rd to feature the \"MoneyMaker\" stipulation. As per the pregame agreement, Kayla walked away with 50% of profits ($10) while the other will be put towards the purchase of brand new dodge balls.\nSPECIAL ATTRACTION:\nECDElite\nInduction\nJustin Wolf\nwas announced as the 14th member of the prestigious\nECDElite\nHall of Fame. Having debuted in the autumn of 2006, he became the highest numbered player - 203 - to receive the honor.\nJUSTIN WOLF\n\u2666\nPlayer Profile\n: Born June 23, 1985; Debut DODGEBALL LVII (57) on September 23, 2006; 73 events participated; right-handed\n\u2666\nCareer Highlights\n: 1x Season Finale headliner; 1x Holiday Special headliner, 1x\nBattle Royal\nChampion\n\u2666\nAwards & Accolades\n: 2010 \"Deflection Defense\"; 2008 \"Rivalry of the Year\" Finalist\n(vs. Juan Londono)\n; 2007 \"Rookie of the Year\" Finalist\n\u2666\nMajor Contributions\n: assisted in creation of current team regeneration targets; put together several musical soundtracks; brought food, drinks, and stereo system to various events; purchased many dodge balls\nSpecial thanks to Rob Knott for once again capturing the video.\nINJURIES\nUnofficial reports claim that Sascha \"Breakdancin'\" Basista may have suffered the sport's plaguing broken finger injury. The former FAMILY AFFAIR 2010 headliner exited ANNIVERSARY 6 rather early, citing the unfortunate incident as reason for his sudden departure. The\nECD\ncommunity certainly hopes that no serious damage has been caused to the wily veteran.\nRECORDS\nTwenty (20) people participated in ANNIVERSARY 6, a turnout comprised of 15 men and 5 women. Two (2) new players were included in the night's attendance: Gary Dietrich and Kayla Knott.\nNotable spectators included Cliff and Linda Gordon (longtime family friends of John Tronolone), friend-to-all Katie Grand, the energetic Logan Teielbaum (Jason Teitelbaum's dog), the delightful Janet Edwards (mother of Michael Edwards), and the one and only Gaile Adams (mother of Chris Adams).\nANNIVERSARY 6 was only the 5th\nECD\nouting held on both the back and front sections of the Wall High School tennis courts. This was mainly due to the unusual light failure that persisted all throughout the extravaganza. As a result, the rarely-seen\nPrison Ball\nwas instituted beginning with Game 4.\nThe official anthem was \"Fascination\" by The Human League. Soundtrack submissions were provided by Jason Teitelbaum, Lauren Stopa, Alison Bertsch, John Tronolone, Kelly Oberto, Rob Knott, and Diana DiBuccio.\nLastly, the preview for ANNIVERSARY 6 featured the first-time appearance of \"The Writer\", the sport's mysterious behind-the-scenes mastermind. The nearly two-minute video preview was a first for\nECD\n.\nNEXT EVENT: October 8, 2011 | 3pm - 7pm\nSURPRISE!",
