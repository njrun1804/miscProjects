  "body_text": "One word to describe DODGEBALL 23 would be \"interesting\". That word doesn't exactly stand for the action itself, but rather the numerous times the event had moved around in the past week. After the collapse of DODGEBALL TWENTY-TWO on the 14th, all were hungry for another quick event. DODGEBALL 23 was set just a few days later, but more problems came about causing the schedule to change once again. Another date was put in place, but only for the TWENTY-TWO-like weather reports to rear their head. The final date of DODGEBALL 23 was certainly a last minute decision, but somehow it worked out ...\n\"Mother Nature\" was incredibly good to all players during 23. The surprisingly warm temperatures allowed many of the competitors to play in T-shirts for the first time since the days at Ocean Road Park. Attendance was also impressive, considering the date had changed quite a bit. DODGEBALL 23 saw 24 compatants square off against each other. And speaking of squaring off, a rematch was a definite must for this fine event. Diana DiBuccio and Alison Bertsch would get another chance to prove once and for all who was the better captain ...\n>> Diana DiBuccio vs. Alison Bertsch\nAnother outstanding match-up just adding to classic list of captain-rivalries. Each individual game was extremely quick. For probably the first time ever, one team had reached double digits [wins] in a single night. Alison had undoubtedly formed a more viscous and ruthless team, allowing her and compatants to score well over the 10-win mark. Diana had her share of victories too, but without question, the night belonged to the \"Bertsch Bregade\" as they dismantled Diana and her apparent defenseless soldiers.\n>> Target Practice ... Top Players of DODGEBALL 23\nThe spotlight belonged to Justin Pierce. Justin hit an unprecendented five \"rims\" [\"garbages\"] in one night. This is a feat that will most likely never be duplicated. He is without question a key factor in Alison's team winning.\nOn the opposing side, you have Louie Freda, the younger brother of HOFer Lauren Freda. Louie, who isn't even a teenager, had some incredible eliminations during the event. His heart and determination gave him bragging rights for life when he eliminated John Tronolone from competition with a shot right to \"The Creation's\" chest. The second, and perhaps bigger elimination, came when the legendary John Watters fumbled a smaller \"bullet\" ball sending him to the sidelines as well. A job well done by the now record-setting youngest player in dodgeball.\nSome honorable mentions certainly go to Lenny Herera, Ryan McCrorey, and Mike \"Sputz\". Lenny had a few good strings of catches during the night. Ryan put on a nice dodging display when he dodged at least 6 balls within a 10 second time frame. And as for Mike, he made up for the times \"The Piercer\" missed the \"rim\". Mike hit two \"rims\" in one night, another impressive number.\nAnd even though she didn't play, Serena Addeo made history when she became the youngest spectator ever at 4 months old.\n>> Since \"The ClimaXX\"\nSpeed-ball ended the infamous DODGEBALL 20 back in late December. For the first time since that momentous event, Speed-ball made its long awaited return. The games were quick and easy. Although it did not last very long, it was the icing on the cake for DODGEBALL 23.\nAnother solid night of dodgeball action continued right through DODGEBALL 23. We now march on with DODGEBALL 24 which takes place January 28th. The final January 2006 event will certainly be one for the ages.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n>> Inside the Game\nI.\nThe dodgeball calendar is listed below.
