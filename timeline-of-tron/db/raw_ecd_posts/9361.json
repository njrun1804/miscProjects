  "body_text": ">>> DODGEBALL 15 Results <<<\nNovember 2005 provided some outstanding dodgeball events to say the least. The month started with the \"Double Header\", DODGEBALLs XONE and XTWO. The following week brought the \"luckiest\" dodgeball of them all with DODGEBALL 13. Just last week, another great event came about with the ever-exciting DODGEBALL XIV. With four memorable events in this month alone, one could have only wondered what the finale would bring ...\nOne prediction was brought to the table: a record-breaking attendance. At DODGEBALL XTWO, a staggering 42 players enjoyed the thrill of dodgeball. With the Thanksgiving holiday this week, questions were raised as the record set just 4 weeks ago could be broken. Many friends were home for the week[end], thus bringing up this very prediction ... However, even with the benefit of the Thanksgiving week, the record set at DODGEBALL XTWO was too much for DODGEBALL 15. But don't let that fool you; DODGEBALL 15's attendance was the 2nd highest in dodgeball history with an incredible 37! Of the 37, 5 newcomers came to try their luck and more so test out their skills at Ocean Road Park. DODGEBALL 15 was already off to one hell of a start ...\nDODGEBALL 15 will probably be remembered as the most team-spirited event ever. Kurt Gassner and Tom Adams, two of the best in the game, were the night's captains. Both men strategically chose their allies, making for a most competitive match-up. The teams couldn't have been more even, as every single game was close. The score itself backs that up, seeing how the last game of the night would determine ultimate team victory and pride and break the 3 to 3 tie. With just minutes left to play, Tom Adams and his ruthless squad finally defeated their resiliant opponents lead by great captain Kurt Gassner in a final score of 4 to 3. As the final elimination came, one can hear the roar of cheers by Tom and his winning team.\nTeams are comprised of singles stars, are they not?\nHere are DODGEBALL 15's standout players and moments ...\nAt this point, most are probably getting tired of hearing about her. But giving credit where credit is due is all apart of the game. Sara DeCuir in the eyes of many, is the greatest female dodgeball player at the present time, and quite possibly, in history. She is one of few women that can hang with anyone.\nKevin Fitzpatrick once again is another player who is becoming almost too feared, too quickly. His incredible power with the \"Green Bullet\" seems unmatched in this great sport.\nEver since DODGEBALL 13, Robert Brown has had his mind set on one goal: eliminate KJohn Tronolone from competition. At 15, Robert reached the \"Promised Land\", as he caught a fastball from \"The Creation\" himself. Robert was facing incredible odds as well, as he was one of the last players left for his team.\nRobert's younger brother Matt also made a splash at 15. This quick newcomer was extremely hard to hit, dodging many balls coming his way. The brothers Brown could very well reach the heights of their older cousin and Hall of Famer, Justin Pierce.\nDODGEBALL DAY 1 veteran Kyle Carty had several good strings of eliminations at 15. His intensity level is very high and he certainly used that to his advantage many a time.\nWhen one thinks of the dreaded \"nut\" shots, only a select few can be mentioned. You have Chris Adams who was nailed in his \"set\" to close out DODGEBALL XTWO. Arguably the worst of these shots came at the wet and rainy DODGEBALL 9, as Tom Adams had to be carried off the court. And then you have Kyle Carty, who seems to get \"low-blowed\" every single event. But what about when a female player is hit \"below the belt\"? ... DODGEBALL 15 gave us that ... In one of the most memorable moments in dodgeball history, Kristin \"Beatles\" Driscoll made the shots mentioned above look like walks in the park. Sara DeCuir and \"Beatles\" were at a standoff, waiting for the other to make the first move. Sara though stepped up first and you can bet she was going for gold [and did she ever find it]. Kristin was unable to block or catch the rifled ball thrown at her, and because of it, was hit square in her \"area\" [for lack of a better or more respectful word]. With the hit came a huge sound, one very difficult to describe. Kristin, with revenge on her mind, crossed over into enemy territory, ready to illegally lauch a ball at her new found foe. But perhaps due to the pain and suffering already inflicted upon her, \"Beatles\" completely missed Sara in the counter attack, despite standing a mere 2 feet away. The battle lasted no more than 1 minute tops, but gave everyone something to remember.\nThe pictures taken by the mind are all that remain of DODGEBALL 15, but for many, they will last a lifetime. November 27th, 2005, the final dodgeball event of the month, delivered in a big way.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nI.\nA possible \"Double Header\" is currently in the works:\nDODGEBALL 18 ~ Friday, December 16th\nDODGEBALL 19 ~ Saturday, December 17th\nThis will occur due to the Christmas holiday taking place the following weekend, in which dodgeball will most likely not take place.
