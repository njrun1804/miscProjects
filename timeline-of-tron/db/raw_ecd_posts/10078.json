  "body_text": ">>> DODGEBALL X6 Results <<<\nIt seemed as if dodgeball couldn't get any bigger. Attendance was very high, new players were coming each week, and overall competition increased. But the first December dodgeball caused a bit of a problem.\nFor weeks, Ocean Road Park has been the home of every single dodgeball event, starting with DAY 1 back in early September all the way up to last week's DODGEBALL 15. X6 was not supposed to be really any different. However ...\nAt about 6:30PM, a half-hour before the start of X6, KJohn, founder and \"creator\" of dodgeball, received a shocking instant message from veteran player Derek Carty. Derek had informed KJohn that the lights to the park had not been on all week long, thus creating a problem for DODGEBALL X6. KJohn knew that he had to go to ORP no matter what, and figure out what to do.\nAs KJohn arrived at ORP, the lights, as Derek had said, were off. But many players were not going to give up or give in. Dodgeball means the world to many of the competitiors and on this night, nothing would stop them from playing. After a few discussions, the final idea was brought up; the Wall High School tennis courts would be the night's location. Just about every player who was at ORP came to play at the high school, and for one thing, that was a wise decision ...\nDespite playing on tennis courts, X6 provided the same excitement and competition that dodgeball has brought for the last 15 events. New rules were instituted however, but created the same amount of fun.\nA) Since there was no basketball hoop to throw/shoot at, garbage cans became the replacement \"rim\" rule. The object was simple; hit the garbage can (or score) and your entire team comes back in the game.\nB) Boundries were a little different as two tennis courts seem to have given a more narrow playing field.\nC) Their was a center line, in which any other week would have disqualified a player if they crossed it. For X6, that rule was in effect [to a degree], but the penalty was certainly not as enforced compared to previous weeks.\nWith these rules, the night still went on as normal as can be. The match-up for the evening would be a first for this great sport ...\nWinner of the \"Most Intense Award\" Ryan McCrorey and outstanding female challenger Sara DeCuir were the X6 captains, making it the first ever \"Inter-gender Captains Match\" in dodgeball's storied history. Like the previous week, players were split very evenly, providing intense games every second of the way ...\nIn only his second time playing, Chris Burke became an established and recognized player. He outlasted many of his opponents (and teammates for that matter), came extremely close numerous times to hitting the difficult and far garbage can, and threw quite well. He is certainly a reason why his team came out the victors.\nSteve Adams took the \"rim\" [garbage] rule to a whole new level. Just about every time Steve had a ball, he aimed directly at the garbage for whatever unknown reason. But to his credit, he was one of few players that actually hit it. The only difference was, Steve hit the can when his entire team was in the game, so it was certainly a wasted and costly effort. But no matter what, Steve's passion, intesity, and charisma can and will never be forgotten. What can we expect from him next week?\nDan Karen could have very well played his best at X6. He eliminated his cousin Chris Adams, who is arguably the greatest dodgeball player ever. Dan also scored two huge eliminations on KJohn Tronolone as well: a game-winning throw and an outstanding catch. A job well done by this seasoned veteran.\nIn somewhat of an unrelated story, Mike \"Sputz\" Krott was having some problems during the night. In what was thought to be an eclipse turned out to be Mike accidently mooning his teammates, as his pants were unable to stay up during the long night. Mike gave many players laughs that they will never forget.\nSingles feuds seemed to have stepped up a notch during X6.\nA) Kevin Fitzpatrick had a few standoffs with Chris Adams and KJohn Tronolone. \"Who throws harder?\" is a question being brought up.\nB) KJohn had other classic faceoffs with Derek Carty, Diana DiBuccio, Dan Karen, Robert Brown, and for the first time ever, Sara DeCuir.\nC) The Brothers Adams showed no brotherly love whatsoever as Tom and Chris were out to destroy Kevin and Steve [and vice versa].\nD) In one of the more recent feuds, Kristin Driscoll was looking for revenge on Sara DeCuir. Kristin had not forgotten what went down last week at 15, and so this is another war that continued right through X6.\nE) It seems as if Dan Spengeman entered his first feud with Travis Mills. You've heard of the \"nut\" shots, but when you get hit in the eye as hard as Dan did, forget about it. Travis put some heat on that ball that sent the Hall of Famer down and out for a good two minutes. Besides that though, both players are fearless as they stay at the front of their packs for most of the time.\nF) Speaking of Travis, could you imagine a battle that included Steve Adams and Ryan McCrorey? A most \"intense\" war it would be. Don't leave out Kurt Gassner either as he is right up there with them.\n... What a night. A tiebreaker match was the decider in this extended night. Ryan's team proved to be the better one during X6 as he and his powerful squad defeated ultimate player Sara with a score of 7 to 6.\nIt was players and rivalries like the ones above which made DODGEBALL X6 an extraordinary event. Many on the roster have expressed their opinion on the event itself, and the feedback has been extremely positive to say the least. There was a bit of concern on everyones' mind as to whether dodgeball would continue or simply collapse under the circumstances. But the dedication and passion of the sport will clearly not fade. There is no question that DODGEBALL X6 was the most unorthodox event ever as rules were changed as well as the obvious change in location. Still, DODGEBALL X6 exceeded all expectations and will be remembered by all who particpated.\nDODGEBALL 17 is the next destination is this long journey and what better way to get things started with a vote to see which possible promotional poster becomes the official DODGEBALL 17 poster ...\n***Please email your votes to Undertaker13yrs@aol.com***\n#1.\n#2.\n#3.\n#4.\n#5.\n#6.\n#7.\n#8.",
