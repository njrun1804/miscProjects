As soon as DODGEBALL 19 concluded, all knew the forthcoming event, DODGEBALL 20, would not take place that next weekend, but the following Friday; for many, an antagonizing 13 days. However, those 13 days are just about half-over: one week remains.\nFor the second time in this incredible journey, \"Dodgeball Excellence\" awards will be given to standout players for various talents and skills. The number of awards is currently undecided but a final decision will be made within the next week.\nThe Hall of Fame will see another induction of stars. The original six, comprised of Dan Spengeman, Mike Rosinski, Lauren Freda, Justin Pierce, Diana DiBuccio, and Chris Adams, will be joined by a \"New Class\". Those deserving individuals will be revealed to the world next week.\nRemember, DODGEBALL 20 will start at 6PM due to the above ceremonies taking place.\n*On a final note, please answer the questions in the email sent earlier in the week.
