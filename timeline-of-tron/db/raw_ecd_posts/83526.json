But allies they were not. The suicidal legend himself Rob Avakian showed not an ounce of remorse on this first of March. With consecutive rounds to his name, the idea of squashing his competition became a reality within just a few short hours.\nHis charismatic counterpart Joey Smalls put up one hell of an performance himself however. Though the conclusive score may tell a different story, make no mistake about it, battle cries from both armies could be heard a mile away.\nAvakian defeated Smalls, 7 - 2\n.\nMoments & Stars\n: the small fireworks display seen in a distance; Robert Brown's striptease between Games 1 and 2; Justin Wolf and Captain Joey Smalls's overall longevity\nRECORDS\nAttendance:\n20\n* (18 men, 2 women)\nNotable Return: Rob Pellecchia (previous DB CXX)\n- DODGEBALL 128 was both the 26th\nWet War\nand 4th\nSnow War\n.\n- In the main event, Rob Avakian easily defeated Joey Smalls by a score of 7 to 2. The win improved Avakian to 2-3-0. This was Smalls's first singles match-up since DODGEBALL 74 in late-January 2007. He is now 1-3-0.\n*\nSeason 13 by the numbers\n: DODGEBALL 124, DODGEBALL CXX7, and DODGEBALL 128 each had turnouts of 20. DODGEBALL 121, DODGEBALL 122, and DODGEBALL CXX-SIX featured 24 superstars.
