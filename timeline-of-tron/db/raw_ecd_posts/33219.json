Who will be the undisputed Captains Champion come DODGEBALL 50?\nBefore that can be answered, the upcoming match will eliminate one of the remaining three competitors: Kevin Adams, John Tronolone, and the 2-time champion herself, Sara DeCuir.\nThis coming weekend will showcase the next great battle between two iron combatants when Sara DeCuir puts the title on the line against a true legend in his own right, Kevin Adams. It's a match that will change the course of history as we know it, catapulting the winner into the final battle before 50 against the annoyingly-arrogant John Tronolone at DODGEBALL 49.\n-- For Sara DeCuir, the past two events have been very generous as well as deserving, defeating then-champion Diana DiBuccio, followed by the epic encounter just last week against Derek Carty. This next match will undoubtedly be the most crucial of them all as she looks to win her third consecutive victory, a feat that has not been accomplished since Joe Kelly's triumph over Travis Mills at DODGEBALL XL. Sara looks to become the second person to gain that important third win. And don't forget, a win increases her chances at headlining the biggest one of the all, DODGEBALL 50, as the one holding the gold.\n-- Ever since he reemerged onto the dodgeball scene at the wet and wild DODGEBALL 45, Kevin Adams has been unstoppable. In the early days of the sport, perhaps the skill [and age] of his older brothers have kept him in the shadows. Interestingly enough, his only run as captain was a loss to his iconic brother, Steve, at DODGEBALL X. But many feel he has finally stepped out of the very shadows of his brothers and the crafty veteran, even at the tender age of 16, looks to take over to dodgeball world within a single night.\nIs he the next champ? He had some choice words about his upcoming engagement:\n\"I've known Sara for as long as I can remember, but that is irrelevant on the court. I intend on bringing my full energy, and I am confident in my ability to pick a winning team. Either way, it will be a fun and competitive event. I will not hold back on her. I hope she respects me enough to do the same.\"\nWill Sara have a response? Who knows. But for one thing, it'll be a fight to the very end.\nThe journey continues ...\nDODGEBALL 48 : 7/15/06 : 6:30pm : WHS",
