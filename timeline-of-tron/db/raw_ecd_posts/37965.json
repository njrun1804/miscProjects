  "body_text": "It all began one year ago. Through the ups, the laughter, the in-your-face action to the cold winter months, the \"invasions\", and battles between one another, there is no denying that dodgeball has been one hell of a ride.\nA lot can happen in one year. To show just how much, dodgeball \"founder\" John Tronolone has categorized each event from DODGEBALL DAY 1 to the present time into certain \"periods\" or \"eras\". Having been to every single event himself, John has seen everything, documenting occurances, happenings, statistics and more into pages and pages of notebooks and computer files along the way.\nIt was he whose idea came alive thanks to 11 of his peers on the inaugural day last September. From then on, dodgeball looked something like this ...\n\"THE BEGINNING\"\nEvents: DODGEBALL DAY 1 to DODGEBALL X\nDates: 9.3.05 - 10.28.05\nThese first events were the foundations of such a sport. Aside from Wall High School, you have the harmless foam footballs, the introduction of the dreaded bulletballs, painballs, the first \"Wet Wars\", and most obviously, the future leaders of the game itself. This was only a preview of things to come.\nNotes:\n- DODGEBALL DAY 1 to DODGEBALL X acquired the likes of over 60 players in just two short months.\n- Ocean Road Park basketball courts used for all events.\n- From DODGEBALL DAY 1 to D-DAY VI, turnouts continued to rise until the first \"Wet War\".\n- The first pictures of an event were taken at DODGEBALL 8.\n- The first and second \"Wet Wars\": DODGEBALL VII and DODGEBALL 9.\n- Dodgeball Excellence Awards and the Hall of Fame were introduced at DODGEBALL X.\n\"THE NEW GENERATION\"\nEvents: DODGEBALL XONE to DODGEBALL 15\nDates: 11.4.05 - 11.26.05\nThe popularity couldn't have been any higher. The first five events of Season 2 saw the emergence of new faces with tremendous atheletic abilities. Legends such as powerhouse Kevin Fitzpatrick, catching machine Lenny Herrera, and the intense Sara DeCuir made immediate impacts on their debut nights. Along with newblood, several players perhaps once overlooked got their chance to shine in some of the most intense and exciting captains matches ever, especially Mike \"Rozz\" Rosinski vs. Kyle Carty at DODGEBALL XONE. This era could accurately be subtitled \"The Era of Devolution\" as many of the veterans were taken to school.\n*This period is often viewed as the first peak of two in dodgeball.\nNotes:\n- Every event took place in November 2005.\n- DODGEBALL 15 would be the last event played at Ocean Road Park until DODGEBALL 30.\n- 24 new players in all, many of which have remained to this day.\n- Various records broken including highest overall attendance at DODGEBALL XONE, only to be broken the very next night at DODGEBALL XTWO. DODGEBALL XTWO still holds the highest male participation of any event with 36.\n- The lowest attendance of this month-long run was 31.\n\"THE TRANSITIONAL ERA\"\nEvents: DODGEBALL X6 to DODGEBALL 20\nDates: 12.3.05 - 12.30.05\nFrom the hallowed grounds of Ocean Road Park came the sudden, and some say unpopular switch to the tennis courts of Wall High School. Through the innitial confusion and perhaps even panic, it was decided by a majority to move play to the very high school in which many players graduated. The reason was simple; all one had to do was press the button for the lights to come on. It was these five events that perhaps changed the game the most as Wall High School became the new home of dodgeball, bulletballs became routine, and trash cans replaced the basketballs rims.\nNotes:\n- Every event took place in December 2005.\n- Despite the sudden switch in location, attendances remained in the high 20s/low 30s.\n- Even after 53 events, many still view DODGEBALL 20 as their favorite event.\n- Of little surprise, the weather saw a large drop in temperature.\n- The last Hall of Fame inductions.\n- Video footage was provided for the first time at DODGEBALL 20, thanks to both Ryan McCrorey and Dan Spengeman. Every \"ten\" event from DODGEBALL 20 to now has been recorded.\n\"THE ICE AGE\"\nEvents: DODGEBALL 21 to DODGEBALL 29\nDates: 1.7.06 - 3.4.06\nThis has to be the roughest period both physically and mentally. The below-freezing temperatures forced many to call it quits at many events. Three \"Wet Wars\" made it seemingly unbarrable to even step outside one's home. Hell, an event was even canceled when the courts were completely iced over! Despite several failed efforts in securing an indoor venue, the journey moved forward as the heart and desire of many of dodgeball's leaders never died. It was truly a time where only the strong survived.\nNotes:\n- Inconsistent turnouts; 30s, 20s, and even teens.\n- DODGEBALL 23 was re-scheduled several times due to the horrendous weather.\n- \"Wet Wars\": TWENTY-TWO, XXV, and TWENTY-SIX.\n- The \"Not JUST a Game\" Documentary was released by DODGEBALL XXV.\n\"THE EVOLUTIONARY EPOCH\"\nEvents: DODGEBALL 30 to DODGEBALL 39\nDates: 3.12.06 - 5.13.06\nEasily the most unorthodox period ever. Ocean Road Park is brought back into the picture with the incredible \"ten\" event, DODGEBALL 30. This wouldn't be the only location change as the Wall High School back courts are used, with the inclusion of \"human\" rims. New games-types, the spring weather, and much more completely reformed dodgeball during these two months.\nNotes:\n- Starting with DODGEBALL 36, attendances saw a steady climb.\n- DODGEBALL 30, DODGEBALL 35, and DODGEBALL 38 were all Ocean Road Park events.\n- There were two \"invasions\" early on from Ocean Township High School students.\n- DODGEBALL XXX-ONE: Prison Ball debuts.\n- DODGEBALL 33: WHS Back Courts used for the first time.\n- DODGEBALL XXX4: Random formation of teams and captains (Names picked out of a hat). Players were also traded.\n- The \"Untraditional Double Header\" with events XXX4 and 35, played on a Friday and the following Sunday, respectively.\n- DODGEBALL 38: Captains Dodgeball debuts.\n- DODGEBALL 39: Dodgeball Battle Royal (\"The Kevin Megill Memorial\") debuts.\n- Events 38 and 39 were the foundations of what would soon become the \"Captains Championship\", thanks to one Joe Kelly.\n- Even the posters see a change as Dan Spengeman starts to design more while John Tronolone uses Photoshop for the first time.\n\"THE POPULOUS WARS\"\nEvents: DODGEBALL XL to DODGEBALL 42\nDates: 5.20.06 - 6.4.06\nWithout a doubt, this was dodgeball's second peak. With school on hiatus for many of the game's best, dodgeball became a great way to enjoy the weekend again. The competition of course grew even more with the official start of the \"Captains Championship\" when Joe Kelly defeated Travis Mills at DODGEBALL XL. Attendances continued to stay at all-time highs, several new female competitors became instant stars, and new players burst onto the scene. It was the perfect time to be a dodgeball player, especially with summer around the corner.\nNotes:\n- DODGEBALL XL used the WHS back courts, DODGEBALL 41 used the front courts, and DODGEBALL 42 was at Ocean Road Park.\n- After the long finale game at DODGEBALL XL, a 3-minute \"last man standing\" rule was put into effect immediately.\n- Chris Burke became the first player to break his finger (DODGEBALL 41).\n- There were 19 new players altogether during these three events.\n- DODGEBALL 41 would break the all-time attendance record with an astounding 47 players. It also shattered the new players record when 15 unknowns became a part of dodgeball history.\n- Quietly subtitled \"Veteran's Day\", DODGEBALL 42 featured 32 past veterans and not one new player.\n- Lenny Herrera would defeat Joe Kelly at DODGEBALL 42 to become new captain's champion.\n\"LIFE IN THE TWENTIES\"\nEvents: DODGEBALL 43 to DODGEBALL 49\nDates: 6.11.06 - 7.22.06\nComing off an incredible and certainly choatic time period came more of the milder events. Starting with Ocean Road Park event DODGEBALL 43, all turnouts would remain lower than 30. The Captain's Championship remained intact, perhaps serving as the highlight of the era itself. With many of the original framers absent, some of the more quiet players became the leaders themselves. Further \"Wet Wars\" and more broken fingers allowed for these mid-summer gatherings something to remember.\nNotes:\n- Except for DODGEBALL 43, all events were played on the WHS back courts.\n- Except for DODGEBALL XLIV, every poster was designed by Dan Spengeman. This was mainly due to his serious finger injury at DODGEBALL 43.\n- Mike \"Sputz\" would become the third player to break his finger. This happened at DODGEBALL 49.\n- Every attendance fell below 30, including a new low of 10 at DODGEBALL 45.\n- Kevin Adams would emerge as the next great captain's champion coming off his victory at DODGEBALL 48 against Sara DeCuir.\n\"THE DOG DAYS\"\nEvents: DODGEBALL 50 to DODGEBALL 53\nDates: 8.4.06 - 8.26.06\nThe dodgeball world witnessed the biggest event in history with the celebratory \"party\" that was DODGEBALL 50. 50 would be the peak event of the summer highlighted by a \"2 vs. 2\" captains battle featuring all four Adams brothers, the birth of the rimshot contests, and a choatic waterballoon fight. The start of Season 6 saw turnouts return to the current norm below 30 and the death of the Captain's Championship allowed the rimshot contests to serve as a new way of choosing team leaders.\nNotes:\n- Kevin Adams would go on to tie Joe Kelly's captains record, securing four-sraight wins.\n- After defeating Kevin Adams at DODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO, Ryan Letsche would retire the championship as per a pre-match agreement.\n- Every event had a pre-game rimshot contest.\n- Both FIFTY-TWO and 53 were \"Wet Wars\".\n- Continuing with the trend from \"Life in the Twenties\", all events except for DODGEBALL 50 would remain below a turnout of 30.\n- Except for DODGEBALL 50, posters continued to be created by Dan Spengeman.\n... There is really no right or wrong answer when categorizing such events. But one thing is for sure, the great sport of dodgeball is exactly what the documentary suggests; this is Not JUST a Game. Acquaitances have become friends, friends have become best friends, and best friends have become family.\nSo whether you've played once or you are one the few on the \"Most Times Played\" List, you have become a part of something huge. No one, not even John himself, could have ever predicted dodgeball to have made it to one full year. That goal will be realized this coming Sunday at DODGEBALL 54.",
