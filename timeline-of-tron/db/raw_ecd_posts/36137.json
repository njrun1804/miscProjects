  "body_text": "After several reviews, there was a slight mistake with the overall turnout for the event.\nIt was previously understood that 46 people attended, putting DODGEBALL 50 as the second highest overall attendance ever. It was believed that Tom Adams was the only player to not sign the sign-in sheet.\nBut after going over the facts again and again, it came to the writer's attention that\nChris Burke\n, an award-winning player at 50,\ndid not\nsign-in either.\nWhat this means is that DODGEBALL 50 tied the record for highest attendance. Now because the records portion of the results page are somewhat incorrect, they have been completely deleted from the entry altogether. They can be seen below.\n~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~\nTHE RECORDS (Updated!)\n> Attendance: 47\nThis tied the record for the largest attendance ever along with DODGEBALL 41 back in late May 2006. It is also the first event to have a turnout above 30 since DODGEBALL 42 back on June 4th, exactly two months earlier.\n> New Players: (8) Brent B, Joe T, Kenny W, Anthony G, Frank G, Kevin C, Dan H, Alexandra R\n> Biggest Returns:\nAimee Savoth (Last played at D-DAY 5)\nSamantha DiFillipo (Last played at DODGEBALL 20)\nMike \"Rozz\" Rosinski (Last played at DODGEBALL 30)\nScotty Ratcliffe (Last played at DODGEBALL 30)\n> Theme songs: Led Zeppelin \"In the Evening\", Rush \"Summertime Blues\", Audioslave \"Show me how to Live\".\n> DODGEBALL 50 was the 21st Ocean Road Park event and the 11th Friday event.\n> Speaking of Ocean Road Park, it was the first event played on the brand new basketball courts, which were redone several weeks ago.\n>\n(UPDATED)\nDODGEBALL 50 had the highest \"veteran\" attendance with 39, meaning that 39 past players participated.\n> DODGEBALL 50 broke the female attendance record with 14. The previous record was at DODGEBALL 41 with 13.\n>\n(UPDATED)\nDODGEBALL 50 took third highest male participation with 33. DODGEBALL XTWO had 36, and DODGEBALL 41 had 34. These are the only three events with 30 or more male players.\n> \"Firsts\" ... 2 vs. 2 captain battle, elimination-style rimshot contest to decide captains, an insane waterballoon fight, and music provided by an iPod.\n> DODGEBALL 50 fell one day after Dan Karen's birthday, one day before Alison Bertsch and Tom Adams's birthday, and was actually on Dan Spengeman's 24th birthday.\n> The new award categories were the \"Nutshot Award\" and the \"King and Queen Award\".\n> Carol DiBuccio, mother of Diana, became the first non-player to win an award.
