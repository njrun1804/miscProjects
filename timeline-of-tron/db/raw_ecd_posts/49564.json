  "body_text": "This entry has nothing to do with the defunct band\nDays of the New\n, but rather the minor changes you can expect right here on\ndodgeball.livejournal.com\nas well as on the court! It's 2007 and that means it time to shake things up.\nI. Results Pages\nThe usuals you can always expect include the records section, the captains match review, and a small build-up for a forthcoming event. All of these classics will remain in the results posts, but a new portion has appeared.\nIf you check out the DODGEBALL 71 results from January 8th, you'll notice a special \"Quotes\" section. This is simply a way of getting more players involved on the website and may even increase the amount of comments on a weekly basis. Someone like Ryan Letsche does not comment too often so to get his words and include them in the actual results is a real treat.\nEach week, every results entry will feature statements by at least two players regarding the corresponding event. It's a fun, new addition here on the dodgeball website, making the posts a little more interesting. Besides, you just never know what someone has to say.\nII. Patterned Posters\nEnough of the fancy, picture-perfect, lava-\"extraordinaire\" portraits competitors are used to seeing. For over a year, Justin Pierce, Dan Spengeman, and most importantly John Tronolone have taken time out of their busy schedules to provide colorful artwork everyone can enjoy. But the creation and design of the promos themselves is very tedious.\nThe posters have taken on a new pattern; a simple logo and creative background. It's a new challenge and may open the doors to a more fair poster contest down the road.\nIII. Rookie of the Year\nWithin the past few weeks, a number of rookies have made their way to the dodgeball playing grounds and have proven to be top dogs right from the get-go.\nSIXTY IX, 70, and 71 combined witnessed an amazing 22 new stars, many of which playing consistently week to week. Sure the veterans of yesterday remain, but for how much longer? The key to dodgeball's survival in 2007 is a wave of new athletes, providing further competition to an already explosive sport.\nYour Ideas\nThere is always that phrase of \"Be Heard!\" on the bottom-right of each entry. If you have any ideas, never be afraid to voice your opinion.\nUntil then, enjoy the insanity of DODGEBALL 72, live at Wall High School!",
