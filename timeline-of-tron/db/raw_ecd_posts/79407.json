One could just sense his physical and mental readiness for the challenge that faced him. The innovative catching phenom Letsche stood in his way, and there wasn't any doubt his preparation and will to win would be at an all-time high.\nIn the early stages of the fierce, and yes, wet onslaught, the athletically-blessed Cornero mounted a successful offense against his never-say-die counterpart. \"Cockroach\" Juan Londono and Season 1 icon Kevin Adams each proved to be two of Cornero's most formidible assets.\nPLAYER of the Year\nnominee Letsche wasn't out though, and made every attempt to take the lead, coming extremely close on mutliple occasions. The self-proclaimed \"Creation\" John Tronolone and hot hands catcher Mike \"Sputz\" Krott would arduously fight to the bitter end.\nBut by the eighth contest, nothing or no one could stop the fueled locamotive Cornero, stomping the competition into oblivian for the remainder of this 120th spectacular.\nFlash Results by Game\n:\nCornero defeated Letsche, 8 - 3.\nCornero: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11\nLetsche: 3, 5, 7\nPitiless pain, cruel punishment, the very medicine Cornero prescribed to his CXX rival general! Plus, Team Letsche's inability to smack the brand-spankin'-new neon star rims ultimately lead to their demise.\nGrant Cornero\ndefeated\nRyan Letsche\n, 8 to 3, at Season 12 Finale, DODGEBALL CXX.\nEastCoastDodgeball\nwould like to congratulate all of the nominees and winners for a fantastic 2007.\nRIVALRY of the Year\n:\nC. Adams vs. Fitzpatrick - Londono vs. T. Adams - Megill vs. Edwards - Basista vs. Marzarella -\nWALL vs. ALL\nWALL vs. ALL took the top prize with about 50% of the vote. The trophy was presented to the creator of this classic feud, Ryan Letsche. The year-long struggle between Chris Adams and Kevin Fitzpatrick placed in a close second.\nNew CONCEPT of the Year\n:\nPickYourPoison Rules - BoxBall Dodgeball -\nCREAMation Rules\n- The Dodgeball Draft\nThe dreaded\nCREAMation Rules\nnarrowly captured the gold in this one. A mere two votes seperated it from\nBoxBall Dodgeball\n. The brains behind the\nCREAMation\n, John Tronolone, received the trophy.\nPLAYER of the Year\n:\nMike Edwards - Lauren Stopa -\nKevin Adams\n- Ryan Letsche\nThe presitgious\nPLAYER of the Year\nmedal was awarded to the legendary Kevin Adams. Interesingly, all of the other condidates shared the same number of votes.\nROOKIE of the Year\n:\nSascha Basista - Michael Butler -\nGrant Cornero\n- Juan Londono - Rob Pellecchia - Justin Wolf\nIn the tightest race, DODGEBALL CXX headliner Grant Cornero squeeked by runner-up Michael \"M Bizzle\" Butler by a single vote. Rob Pellecchia scored an impressive third, only trailing Cornero by two votes.\nSeason 12\n~ Wall's third triumph over All, the colossal \"War to Settle the Scores\" at CXV,\nJohn vs. Tom\nat the Second Annual Christmas Special, and the returning \"Double Header\" were just some of the highlights over the last ten weeks.\n~ Season 12's average attendance was 26.3. The sport witnessed the introduction of 14 new stars.\n~ DODGEBALL 116, DODGEBALL 118, DODGEBALL CXX were all\nWet Wars\n.\n~ Diana DiBuccio, Kevin Adams, Ryan Letsche, and John Tronolone participated in all Season 12 events.\nDODGEBALL CXX\n~ One would have thought it was flag day. Four huge yellow and blue flags, six smaller flags attached to the tennis poles and table, white and blue streamers draped along the fence - don't forget about the Christmas lights either!\n~ First pick for Cornero:\nKevin Adams\n~ First pick for Letsche:\nJohn Tronolone\n~ The 50/50 Raffle earned $35, split equally between the winners Rob Pellecchia and Kevin Megill.\n~ The celebratory afterpaty was held at Pete and Elda's in Neptune! Nearly 20 superstars gathered for the occasion!\n~ The red hot CXX Soundtrack produced such hits from the popular Top Gun movie, various Spanish anthems including \"La Bamba\", and the comedic \"Barbie Girl\". Disturbed, Amber, Finger Eleven, and so many more could also be heard live and loud.\nDODGEBALL 121 Match\nThe sport's headed to Philadelphia! Okay, not really. Brothers battle it out when\nMichael Butler\ntakes on\nJim Butler\nat the Season 13 opening!\nDODGEBALL CXX - the grandest way to kick-off the new year! Here are few moments!\n~ Bobby Vetrano over-inflating many of the bulletballs.\n~ The neon pink and orange Star Rims.\n~ Diana DiBuccio blowing her trumpet to begin the show.\n~ Chris Adams and Melissa Kerr the only combatants to earn a team regeneration.\n~ \"Last Man Standing\" performances from both Kevin Fitzpatrick and Rob Pellecchia.\n~ Justin Wolf's night-long catches.\n~ Sascha Basista successful dodges while parading around with an American flag.\n~ Chris Adams destroying one of the colorful flags with a powerful bulletball throw.\nAttendance of DODGEBALL CXX was\n28\n.\nFor the first time in ten event history, there were no new players.\nNotable returns include Jim Martin (last competed at DB 100), Michelle Mullins (last competed at DB 114), Valerie Winston (last competed at DB 114), Lauren Winston (last competed at DB 114), and Steve Pham (last competed at DB CXV).\nDODGEBALL CXX was the sixth season finale held on the back courts of Wall High School. The newly-created orange and pink\nLetsche Rims 2008\nwere used for the first time.\nDODGEBALL CXX was the first ten event held in the month of January.\nThe official theme song was \"Ready to Go\" by Republica.\nIn one of the more rare occurrences, CXX was\nWet War XXIV\n. This was the third ten event\nWet War\n(along with DODGEBALL 30 and DODGEBALL 80) and the third\nWet War\nin the last five events.\nThis was the second event to feature a 50/50 Raffle (the first being DODGEBALL 100). By the end of the night, Rob Pellecchia and Kevin Megill were $17.50 richer.\nIn the first main event of 2008, Grant Cornero defeated Ryan Letsche 8 to 3.\n--\nLetsche\nparticipated in his second ten event, the other being DODGEBALL 100.

His efforts are very much appreciated as well.\nCXX Soundtrack!\nSpecial\nThanks!\nto the legendary Ryan Letsche who put together one hell of a soundtrack for this 120th spectacle.\nYou Peeps Rock!\n2005, 2006, 2007, and now 2008; just how much longer will the incredible  journey last?!
