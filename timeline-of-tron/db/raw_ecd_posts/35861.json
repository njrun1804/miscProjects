Ocean Road Park ...\n~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~\nTHE AWARDS\n\"Dodgeball Excellence Awards\" have been around since the first of these events, October 2005's DODGEBALL X. Unlike previous times however, many would agree that the awards given at DODGEBALL 50 had little to nothing to do with athletic ability.\nNutshot Award\nAn award simply based on comedy (and pain). Given to the player who has received the most number of nutshots.\n---> Recipient at DODGEBALL 50: Tom Adams\nKing and Queen Award\nA special award given to the most dominant, recognized couple in dodgeball.\n---> Recipients at DODGEBALL 50: Chris Adams & Lauren Freda\nAct of Courage Award\nGiven to a competitor(s) who participated with any serious injury.\n---> Recipients at DODGEBALL 50: Kevin Fitzpatrick, Chris Burke, Mike \"Sputz\" Krott\nThe only past winner of this award is Kevin Adams at DODGEBALL 20.\nPainball Powerhouse Thrower\nA version of the famed Powerhouse Thrower Award, this is given strictly to those who throw one of the larger painballs perhaps harder than anyone.\n---> Recipient at DODGEBALL 50: Zach Katz\nZach is the first winner of the Painball Powerhouse Thrower Award. Past winners of the more classic award are Chris Adams and Mike \"Rozz\" Rosinski at DODGEBALL X, John Watters and Kevin Fitzpatrick at DODGEBALL 20, Alison Bertsch at DODGEBALL 30, and Kevin Megill at DODGEBALL XL.\nHigh Jump Award\nGiven to the player(s) who jumps amazingly high, dodging at the same time.\n---> Recipient at DODGEBALL 50: John Tronolone\nThe only past winner of this award is Derek Carty at DODGEBALL 30.\nMost Intense Award\nOne of the more recognized awards, this is given to the players who are the most energetic and [obviously] intense on the court.\n---> Recipient at DODGEBALL 50: Kurt Gassner and Derek Carty\nPast winners include Ryan McCrorey and Steve Adams at DODGEBALL X, Travis Mills and Sara DeCuir at DODGEBALL 20, and Joe Kelly at DODGEBALL XL.\nAppreciation Award\nGiven to those individuals who contributed to dodgeball, on and/or off the court.\n---> Recipients at DODGEBALL 50: Dan Karen, Ryan Letsche, Diana & Carol DiBuccio.\nPast winners include Ryan McCrorey at DODGEBALL 20, Kathryn Nogueira and Dan Spengeman at DODGEBALL 30, and Justin Pierce and Kevin Megill at DODGEBALL XL.\n~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~\nTHE CAPTAINS\nKevin Adams was faced with a most-unique challenge at DODGEBALL 50. A first of its kind, 50 would see a 2 vs. 2 captains battle, with his challenging team given the chance to face him [and a partner of his choosing] if they won a simple, little contest. The contest, another first, was an elimination-style rimshot contest. Pairs of two lined up at half court, all wanting that golden opportunity to be in the main event.\nThe contestants themselves were only a fraction of the well-established veterans the sport has ever seen: Ryan Letsche & Ryan McCrorey, Dan Turner & Ray Marzarella, Wesley Hebrew & Lenny Herrera, Diana DiBuccio & John Tronolone, Tom Adams & Chris Adams, Derek Carty & Steve Adams, Mike \"Sputz\" & Chris Burke, and Valerie Winston & Lauren Winston.\nAfter the first round, not a single player hit the rim. But of course as fate would have it, Chris Adams in the second round scored, advancing him and his brother Tom into the next round. Immediately following, Dan Turner would also hit rim, placing he and his \"Pond Scum\" partner Ray in the third, and soon-to-be final round. All other teams however failed to score, thus leaving the two teams. In the end, again it was the legend himself Chris Adams securing the winning rimshot as he and his brother Tom awaited the confrontation against their youngest brother Kevin. Who would Kevin choose to be his partner in crime?\nIt was only fitting that the reigning champ would pair-up with his other brother Steve, pitting all four of the Adams brothers in the captains match-up. The most recognized family in the sport took center stage at the biggest event ever! Tom and Chris vs. Kevin and Steve!\nTHE MATCH\nIt will easily go down as one of the most unorthodox matches in history. Perhaps based on fun rather than competition and ability, in the end, singles champion Kevin Adams along with his \"Most Intense\" brother Steve defeated the legendary duo, and don't forget siblings, Chris and Tom with a final score of 5 to 3. A grueling, four hour match that will certainly be remembered for a long time. Until DODGEBALL 50, Chris and Tom had undefeated captains records of 2-0.\n~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~\nTHE EXTRAS\nAfter weeks of preparation, DODGEBALL 50 will long be remembered as the most \"fun\" event for a majority in attendance. A number of surprises were in store, and many would agree it took even the slightest bit of competition out of the event.\nHungry?\nAlthough food had been \"served\" at a few previous events, never before had there been such a set-up as well as a variety until DODGEBALL 50.\nA.S.K. FoodsIncs.\n, later revealed to mean \"Aimee, Samantha, and Kathryn\", baked for the 40-plus in attendance. Plates of cookies and rice crispy treats were gone by event's end. If one wasn't into the sugar, perhaps the potato chips offered by Kevin Megill appeared appetizing. And on a hot summer day, what would have DODGEBALL 50 been without ice pops! Thank Diana DiBuccio for those.\nA Wet Surprise!\nThe biggest surprise at this milestone event was, for many players, the most memorable part of DODGEBALL 50. After the almost one-hour long and certainly physically draining first game, it was time to bring out the mysterious coolers that would soon stand in the middle of the court. As the lids opened, the rays of sunlight shined upon waterballoons!\nIt will long be considered as the most chaotic five minutes ever witnessed at a dodgeball event.\nBroadcasting Live!\nAs part of the tradition, Dan Spengeman started off what would soon be the longest dodgeball video ever made, running well over one hour and 45 minutes. Others, especially Ben Cotta and Lauren Winston, recorded plenty of action, comedy, interviews, and even bug-chasing that an event can have. Ben even managed to capture the insane waterballoon fight!\nThe iPod\nSeriously, what more could Kathryn Nogueira do to make DODGEBALL 50\nthe\npremier event?\nAfter being given a mix list of songs, Kathryn allowed for music to be heard live and loud at DODGEBALL 50 using her very own iPod. As if the event wasn't unpredictable already, she secretly snuck in some of her own songs, many of which weren't exactly \"dodgeball material\". As the event worn on however, it only added laughter to an already extraordinary event, listening to likes of Janet Jackson and Paula Abdul.\n~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~\nTHE MEMORIES\nUsually during the results, there is a section dedicated to the top stars of the corresponding event. But seeing how DODGEBALL 50 reached an attendance well over 40, how could anyone choose even one standout performer? Some memorable moments have been replaced instead!\n- Melissa Kerr's impactful shoulder shot on one Mike \"Rozz\" early on in the night.\n- Tom Adams and John Tronolone's alliance throughout the entire event, despite being on seperate teams. They never once threw a ball at each other.\n- Steve Adams nailed Dan Fitzpatrick with arguably the worst nutshot of the modern dodgeball era. Wesley Hebrew managed to capture this on tape.\n- Aimee Savoth on the receiving end of a forceful faceshot, delivered by new player, powerhouse thrower Joe Trestle.\n- Lenny Herrera's apparent refusal to participate in the waterballoon fight made for a great plan by Justin Pierce and Ryan McCrorey as they drenched him with a water-filled cooler. Two seconds later, Lenny was eliminated from the game with a bulletball shot by one Kevin Adams.\n- The adorable brother/sister combo of Scotty and Alexandra Ratcliffe against the likes of Kurt Gassner, John Tronolone, among others.\n- John Watters's thigh shot on Kevin Adams in the latter part of the evening sent the very same ball into Kevin Chapman's face.\n- Steve Adams dressing up as The Hurricane much like his DODGEBALL X appearance.\n- Dan Spengeman returning to action after having his left pinky finger surgically repaired while suffering the severe injury at DODGEBALL 43.\n- The hilarious picture of Justin Pierce posted around several places on the court; much thanks to Ryan McCrorey.\n- The lights going out \"early\" though most cell phones and watches said 9:58.\n~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~\nA SPECIAL THANK YOU\nThanks to everyone who made or brought food. Diana DiBuccio for the ice pops, Kevin Megill for the chips, and \"A.S.K.\" who actual spent the day baking, then serving at the event itself.\nBrent Bitsko, Kevin Adams, Diana DiBuccio, John Tronolone, Mike \"Rozz\", and Lauren Winston, should all be thanked for their efforts in decorating, filling up the waterballoons, etc. Despite the event starting at 5pm, many of them were there by 3.\nAnd of course thanks to EVERYONE who came, saw, participated ... WE, together, made DODGEBALL 50 the event of a lifetime!\n~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~\n... Will you ever forget DODGEBALL 50 ...",
