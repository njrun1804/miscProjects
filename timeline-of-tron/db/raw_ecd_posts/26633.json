As noted already, the first took place at the very first Wall High School event, DODGEBALL X6 back on December 3rd. Two of the most intense athletes ever squared off; Ryan McCrorey and Sara DeCuir.\nFive months later at the start of the new month of May, Sara did it again, this time going head-to-head with intense and charismatic player, Joe Kelly.

The match itself could go down as one of the most memorable of all-time, especially with the addition of a new game-type of \"Captain Dodgeball\". Both captains formed athletic teams, making for an exciting event.\nTop Stars of DODGEBALL 38\nA Message from John Tronolone:\n\"As witnessed at DODGEBALL 38, I took one hell of a spill in the first few minutes of the night. Normally I'd post info about standout players, but obviously due to what happened to me, I was't able to capture much of others' participation. A few things I do remember though was Bill Plantz not just hitting rim, but actually making it in the hoop. Lenny Herrera, who was standing in front of me, made what I thought was one of the sickest catches I've personally evey seen, done in mid-air. Steve Adams eliminated in all three of his brothers within one minute (And yes Chris, I know the story ((lol)).\nAs for me, and a few of you have expressed your concern, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sore. My knees, [especially my right] are pretty banged up. My neck, elbows, and chin are also quite bruised. At the moment, my most painful injuries are without question my left hip and right wrist.\nI've have always believed that if I didn't come home sore, bruised, etc. from a dodgeball event, then I wasn't playing my hardest. As for you Kevin Adams, who hit me in the shoulder less than a second prior to my fall, you will pay for you crime!\"\nDODGEBALL 39\nDODGEBALL 39 is this coming Saturday, May 13th, starting at 6:30pm. As a result of 38's loss of dodge balls, it would be a smart move to head back to Wall High School for this event. For those unaware, Kevin Megill has already bought two new dodgeballs. His efforts as always are greatly appreciated.\nDODGEBALL 40\nThere are only two weeks that seperate you, the dodgeball crew, from another milestone, \"ten\" event: DODGEBALL 40. DODGEBALL 40 will also take place at Wall High School, starting a half-hour earlier than the normal time, at 6pm. As it has been preached time and again, those who have yet to attend a \"ten\" event, they are considered to be favorites, especially among many veterans.\nThe theme song, facts and stats, and much more are in preparation. DODGEBALL 40 is Saturday, May 20th.",
