  "body_text": "... the first\nSnow War\n, two birthday celebrations, a memorable dodgeball tournament, numerous pizza parties, twenty-three new stars ...\nwelcome to the Season 8 finale ...\n~ ~ ~ the MATCH ~ ~ ~\nThis one will live on as one of the all-time great battles dodgeball has ever witnessed. Two of the most distinguished athletes, with two very different styles, took center stage at the biggest event of the 2007 year. There wasn't a better way to end Season 8 than with a match that brought such excitement\nand\ncompetition.\nThe inexperienced, first-time captain Mike Edwards against the three and \"0\" Kevin Megill.\nIt was an extremely rough first half for powerhouse Megill. The first three games left him stranded in the cold, fighting for survival. Edwards had clearly formed an awesome squad, taking these crucial games.\nBy Game 4, the balance of power shifted when Team MEGILL began to decimate Team EDWARDS. But the defensive efforts and strategic offensive plays of Team EDWARDS were proven strong as they rebounded nicely and somehow picked up the fourth game. The score was a brutal 4 to 0, looking to become a record-setting fourth \"Slaughter Victory\" in the past five weeks. Would Edwards hold on to the lead?\nKevin had had enough. The fifth game was the turning point in this match of the year candidate. One by one, Team EDWARDS was picked off, and a hard-fought Game 5 went into the win column for Team MEGILL. The uphill battle continued, but slowly but surely, Kevin Megill led his team towards victory in both Game 6 and Game 7. The supposed shut-out victory was not meant to be.\nGame 8 would decide it all. Megill had the opportunity to tie this historic series at 4. Edwards however was going for gold, and rightfully so.\nThe final game of the night witnessed history unfold when the legendary dodging extraordinaire Mike Edwards defeated the feared icon Kevin Megill. This was the fatal blow in what could have been one of the biggest comebacks ever recorded.\nMike Edwards defeated Kevin Megill at the 80th dodgeball extravaganza, 5 - 3.\n\"Kevin Megill was a beast.\"\n- MIKE EDWARDS\n\"An amazing match! Megill vs. Edwards delivered!\"\n- JOHN TRONOLONE\n~ ~ ~ the EXTRAS ~ ~ ~\nAbout DODGEBALL 80\n>> The return of the Christmas lights along the tennis nets as well as the light blue streamers.\n>> iPod failures of both John Tronolone and Chris Adams. Thankfully Alison Bertsch's iPod [along with \"Fitz\"'s radio] provided energetic music.\n>> All of the new players except for Rob Kenny were on Team MEGILL.\n>> Kevin Megill outlasting all of his teammates in the first three games of DODGEBALL 80.\n>> John Tronolone, Kevin Adams, and Kevin Fitzpatrick collectively earned 9 rimshots on the night.\n>> The presentation of the\nTOM FUND\n: an even\n$62\nfor Luke! And he delivered even more pizza!\n>> The extremely windy, cold weather. Snow included!\n\"I was chilled to the bone.\"\n- MIKE EDWARDS\nAbout Season 8\n>> Juan Londono debuted at DODGEBALL 73 and has yet to miss an event.\n>> Chris Adams, Diana DiBuccio, John Tronolone, Kevin Fitzpatrick, and Kevin Megill participated in every Season 8 event (DODGEBALL 71 - DODGEBALL 80).\n>> There were three \"Slaughter Victories\" this season: Fitzpatrick over Stopa (LXXVI); T.Adams over L.Winston (77), C.Adams/Megill over Tronolone/Londono (79).\n>> There were 25 new stars in all during these past two and a half months.\n>> Notable returns: Kristen Driscoll (72), Guy Ritt (72), Dan Spengeman (80).\n~ ~ ~ the RECORDS ~ ~ ~\n- The attendance was 24, tying DODGEBALL X for the lowest turnout ever at a ten event.\n- Dan Spengeman made the biggest comeback, having not participated since DODGEBALL LX.\n- The were 6 new outstanding stars: Jeff Carton, Ian Halsey, Oliver Doclosen, Rob Kenny, Joe Rispoli, and Dave Branin.\n- DODGEBALL 80 fell on St. Patrick's Day. It was also the final event to take place during Winter 2006/2007.\n- The theme song was \"All My Life\" by the Foo Fighters.\n- This was the first, and likely only, \"Snow War\" ten event. This is only the second \"Snow War\" in dodgeball history. It's the second \"Wet War\" ten event following DODGEBALL 30, the 15th \"Wet War\" overall.\n- DODGEBALL 80 has the distinction of being the only ten event to\nnot feature\na sign-in sheet and the \"Dodgeball Excellence\" Awards*. It's only the second ten event (after DODGEBALL X) to not feature any video footage either.\n*The\nTOM FUND\nwas presented to Luke at 80, collecting an even $62.\n- The large tennis lights went off at 9pm due to daylight savings time.\n- In Mike Edwards first try as captain, he defeated the undefeated Kevin Megill by two games. This was Kevin's second captains go at a ten event following DODGEBALL 30. (There was no\nPrison Ball\n).\n- Excluding DODGEBALL 80 new blood, the following competitors made their ten-event debut: Juan Londono and Pam D'Luhy.\n- Both Kevin Adams and John Tronolone attended DODGEBALL 80. They are the only two players to have partaken in all 8 season finales.\n~ ~ ~ the END ~ ~ ~\n\"I thought it was fun. I was FREEZING, but the flurrying had an awesome affect!
