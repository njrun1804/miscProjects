DODGEBALL LVIII, to put it rather bluntly, was nothing like that at all.\nThe Open Challenge and \"HTH\" Contest\nIt was a special night already as earlier in the week, an open challenge was issued by a very hungry female veteran featured on the dodgeball poster. But her opponent had yet to be decided, thus setting up a most unusual situation.\nInstead of someone answering to her challenge or even a rimshot contest for that matter, the all-new \"Hit the Human\" contest was introduced. The object of the pre-game was to simply to hit a volunteer player standing against the fence. Those who \"hit the human\" moved on until there was one person left standing. Plain and simple, it's a rimshot contest using a human.\nFirst off, DODGEBALL LVIII needed a volunteer. Honestly, who better could it have been than the legend himself, Justin Pierce! But of course he was met with the likes of some of the hardest throwers ever: Andrew DeSarno, Jim Butler, Alison Bertsch, John Tronolone, Robert Brown, Chris Yoda, and Dan Spengeman.\nImmediately, the young Andrew DeSarno hit \"The Piercer\" in the very first round, who was then followed by Pierce's very own cousin, Robert Brown. With only the two men remaining, Robert Brown capped the hungry prodigy, winning the first-ever HTH Competition, and more importantly, the right to face the woman who threatened the dodgeball world throughout the week ... Alison Bertsch!\n---- Alison Bertsch vs. Robert Brown\nBad luck: one thing Robert has dealt with for the past three weeks. He was narrowly defeated by Max O'Rielly at DODGEBALL FIFTY-FIVE in a great captains showdown. His own girlfriend Lindsay Gough suffered the same fate the following week, LVI, losing to powerhouse Jim Butler. Then last week his brother Matt went one-on-one against Lenny Herrera in an exciting rematch, also failing to triumph. When would the bad luck stop? \"Powerhouse Thrower\" award-winner Alison Berstch had something to say about that.\nIn many ways, DODGEBALL LVIII did nothing to mirror any of its predecessors. But there was one very huge similiarity between LVIII and last week's DODGEBALL LVII.\nAgain, in unusual fashion, LVIII looked exactly like this:\nGame 1:\nAlison wins\nGame 2:\nAlison wins\nGame 3:\nAlison wins\nGame 4:\nRobert wins\nGame 5:\nRobert wins\nGame 6:\nRobert wins\nGame 7:\nRobert wins\nGame 8:\nRobert wins\nEverything was going according to planned for Alison. But with the addition of new players midway through, most notably Tom Adams, the tide took a turn for the worse, handing the only female \"Powerhouse Thrower\" award-winner her first loss as captain. Robert Brown's luck may have just done a\n180\n.\n- Kevin Megill was a dynamite player, eliminating by the masses due to his seemingly unmatched aim at DODGEBALL LVIII.\n- Tom Adams's put on as usual another all-around performance, perhaps stealing the show at DODGEBALL LVIII.\n- Showing plenty of heart and toughness, Chris Yoda and Andrew DeSarno yet again proved that it's not always about being the biggest or the oldest.\n- Though still injured and in a cast, Diana DiBuccio should be applauded for her participation at DODGEBALL LVIII. It was a true \"act of courage\" ...\nRobert Brown defeated Alison Bertsch 5 to 3.\nLVIII Records\n- Attendance: 14\n- Biggest Return: Diana DiBuccio (Last played at DODGEBALL 54 / One Year Anniversary)\n- New Players: 0\n- The new \"Hit the Human\" Competition was introduced at DODGEBALL LVIII, with Robert Brown its first winner.\n- Captains Records after LVIII: Alison 1-1-1, Robert 2-1-0.\n- Alison Bertsch became only the fourth woman to participate in an intergender captains battle, following the likes of Sara DeCuir (X6, 38, 47, 48), Diana DiBuccio (45), and Lindsay Gough (LVI).\n- Even before the HTH Contest, a small 6-man team battle went down.\nAnother Added Bonus at DODGEBALL LVIII!\nAlison Bertsch vs. Robert Brown\nwas the featured match-up for LVIII. But before the action began, a smaller pre-game dodgeball match took place. It pitted six of dodgeball's finest:\nDan Spengeman and Kevin Megill would join in later on as well, turning the already intense 3 vs. 3 team battle into a huge eight-man war. In the end, Andrew, Mike, John, and Dan prevailed 4 games to 2.",
