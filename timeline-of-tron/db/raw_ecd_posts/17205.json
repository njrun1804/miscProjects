  "body_text": "Who knows what to think these days ...\nThere has no doubt been some interesting occurances at recent dodgeball events. Actual participation seems to be dropping, yet spectators have been on the rise. And then there is missing players, most notably at the most recent event, DODGEBALL XXIV.\nCould January have been an unlucky month or is it really the beginning of the end of the long \"journey\" known as dodgeball?\n.........\nIn regards to attendance, XXIV can be much compared to DAY 1 and DAY 2. At first, the attendance was looking to be a record low, as only 14 were split into two teams. The night proceeded on and about half-way into the event, attendance had risen. Diana had guessed correctly: there were 21 players. Had many of the spectators played, that number would have risen at least 8.\nThe absence of certain veteran players turned the night into a shocker for many of the participants. It was previously known that Steve Adams would miss his very first event since his debut. That did happen, but what a run it was for him, playing from DAY 2 all the way up to DODGEBALL 23. Ryan McCrorey missed DODGEBALL XXIV as well, making it only about the third time he's missed since his inaugural night at DAY 4. But the surprise came when Dan Spengeman was no where to be found. Dan was busy at school the previous night and had gotten no sleep. He arrived extremely late to XXIV, and by that time, the event was just about over.\nDespite those \"missing in action\", some returns were at hand. Kevin Megill, one of the most beloved players all of time, finally stepped back onto the dodgeball court. He had not been since DAY 4 and many to this day had wondered where he had gone. He was obviously not hard to find on January 28th, 2006.\nEver since DODGEBALL 20, Joe Kelly had not gotten a taste of dodgeball. Joe is a great addition to dodgeball and many would like to see him play \"full-time\".\nOther returns saw Matt Larsen, Jack Mess, and Chip Terhune compete once again, all of which had not been since DODGEBALL 21. Their presence was certainly felt at XXIV.\n> Onto the match ...\nChris Adams back at DODGEBALL 20 thought of a very interesting idea; \"Prodigy\" Captains. This dealt with the two winners of the \"Prodigy Awards\" at that very event, Matt Brown and Lenny Herrera. Matt and Lenny would indeed square off ... but even the results caused a bit of confusion for one John Tronolone.\nA question remains:\nWhich team won? If anyone has the answer to this, please respond.\n_______________________________\n> Onto the players ...\nBoth captains were standout players. The younger cousin of \"The Piercer\", Matt Brown, has to be the hardest player to hit. He dodges well and can also deflect. His throwing is also good, despite being one of the youngest players in history. As for Lenny, he had some impressive catches, many of which were launched \"bullet\" balls [the hardest ones to catch in the eyes of many].\nKevin Megill could have been the standout performer for the evening. His blocking, and more so deflections, were superb. When it was time to throw, he delivered many a time.\nDiana DiBuccio also did her share of damage offensively with some impressive throws. Her catching was even better though, eliminating some of the best players around.\nIt has been said numerous times, but just how good is Alison Bertsch. She is arguably the hardest throwing female ever, using a tremendous amount of force. Her defense during XXIV provided some funny moments when she was hit several times in her \"region\".\n_______________________________\n> The Extras\nSince D-DAY 5, \"invasions\" [whether physical or verbal], were null and void, thus eliminating any chances of conflict with the \"outside world\". But at DODGEBALL XXIV, an obnoxious group of apparent Ocean Township High School students went on a verbal rampage, trash talking everyone in site. They left very quickly however when Chip Terhune called the local police, scaring the cowards away. A very interesting turn of events. What could happen next week?\nLike mentioned earlier, the absence of players hurt the numbers overall. For the first time ever, not one new player debuted. There have been events where only one player was new to the game. But on this night, everyone who participated had played at a previous event.\n_______________________________\n> The Future ...\nTwo gigantic and revolutionary events will be here in no time.\nOn the eve of DODGEBALL XXV, top player Diana DiBuccio will be throwing a \"Dodgeball Dinner\" for all players of dodgeball. Fliers were distributed to all in attendance at XXIV, so the the word is definitely out. If more information comes up, check your emails or myspace accounts for further details.\nThen of course the big one ... DODGEBALL XXV. \"25 Momentous Events, One Historical Night\" reads on the poster. That phrase couldn't be more fitting. DODGEBALL XXV will easily go down as one of the biggest events in history, showcasing the talents of these warriors, while many spectators look on. DODGEBALL XXV will start at its regular time of 7PM. This will be a monumental event as we not only enter into a new month, but perhaps a new era.\n_______________________________",
