  "body_text": ">>> DODGEBALL 20: The ClimaXX <<<\n*** Official DODGEBALL 20 Theme Song: Filter \"Hey Man, Nice Shot\" ***\nJOHN TRONOLONE: \"Did you ever think dodgeball would make it this far?\"\nCHRIS ADAMS: \"I knew it'd be big in the autumn, but December into January? Had no idea. I love this level of commitment, especially from the hardcore females (even if they're on coffee runs) and the injured people. Dedication is unmatched.\"\n..........\nChris Adams hit the nail right on the head. Dedication, passion, drive, the list goes on and on. Players from various parts of the county (and state for that matter) have set aside three hours in their schedules, whether it be school or work, and enjoyed an amazing sport. Starting with DODGEBALL DAY 1 on September 3rd, 2005 and continuing all the way up to DODGEBALL 19, all events in between were awesome. There was room for one more event of the year, and it was only fitting that it would be the biggest one of them all.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe AWARDS\nThe night started just like DODGEBALL X with \"Dodgeball Excellence\" Awards. The attendance was already high, so many competitors, old and new, witnessed history right in front of their eyes. The awards go as followed:\n> The Act of Courage Award <\n*Injured Player Award*\nKEVIN ADAMS\n> Powerhouse Thrower Awards <\nKEVIN FITZPATRICK\nJOHN WATTERS\n> Most Intense Awards <\nTRAVIS MILLS\nSARA DECUIR\n> Trash Talking Award <\nJUSTIN PIERCE\n> Prodigy Awards <\n*Standout players that debuted after DODGEBALL X and are much younger than most players*\nLENNY HERERA\nMATT BROWN\n> Appreciation Award <\n*Most contributions*\nRYAN MCCROREY\n> Picture Framed Award <\n*Player that has provided the most memories*\nSTEVE ADAMS\nThere was one other award for \"Perfect Attendance\" to be given to Diana DiBuccio. But in a shocking turn of events, she no-showed DODGEBALL 20.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe HALL OF FAME\nThe Hall of Fame caused a bit of concern this time around for one KJohn Tronolone. The problem came with the men, as many players are worthy of being inducted into such an elite group. KJohn wanted to make sure he only inducted the best of the best, especially now that the HOF has been established. The male inductees were put on hold at DODGEBALL 20 and will [hopefully] be revealed within the next few weeks once decisions are made.\nThe female choices were obvious though:\n> VALERIE WINSTON\nValerie debuted at the inaugural dodgeball back in early September, and since then, has improved with each passing week, eliminating some of the biggest names ever including Chris Adams, Justin Pierce, and Tom Adams. She had improved so much that by DODGEBALL X, she had won \"Most Improved Player\". She has only missed a total of 3 events, but even with those absences, she seemed to have never lost a step.\n> SARA DECUIR\nSara debuted at DODGEBALL XONE and without question, sent shockwaves around the entire league. She was noticed from that day forward as her throwing, catching, and incredible stamina and intensity made her one of the biggest targets. Besides her physical talents, she is also fearless, approaching the front line a large portion of the time. To Sara\u2019s credit as well, she only missed one event (XTWO).\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe MATCH\nImmediately after awards were distributed, teams were formed. KJohn was desperate to be captain and no one had any problem with that. The opposing captain would be a player who had not participated since DODGEBALL 13, due to a nasty ankle injury. His name is Jim Martin.\nYou would think never being captain before as well as missing several events would have Jim at a disadvantage. The tables were turned however, as KJohn ended up with the struggle. Both forces were awesome, but Jim\u2019s was obviously better, seeing how they dominated the first hour or two of competition. It was 4 to 1 right around the 9 o\u2019clock mark. Would \"The Creation\" strike back?\nJohn and his awesome allies did indeed mount a counter-strike, but an attack that would not be strong enough. The war concluded with a final score of 6 to 4; Jim Martin defeating KJohn Tronolone. Both teams had acquired some of the finest talent around and those individuals deserve the proper respect.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe PLAYERS\nProving once again to be a worthy member of the Hall of Fame, one of Valerie Winston\u2019s key eliminations of the night came at the hands of the legendary Chris Adams. Valerie\u2019s sister, Lauren, could very well take after her older sibling seeing how she eliminated HOFer Dan Spengeman.\nThere is no question Kevin Fitzpatrick could be the most feared player of all time. The way that Kevin throws makes the \"Powerhouse Thrower\" Award appear as a joke. Besides his throwing though, Kevin had some impressive diving catches as well.\nThere is only one man in the history of dodgeball that can play without footwear and his name is Chris Daly. Chris, a semi-regular to the sport, seemed to have played better barefoot. He debuted at D-DAY VI and has since brought a high level of intensity and charisma that many notice. His performance at DODGEBALL 20, shoes or no shoes, will be remembered for a long time to come.\nKJohn Tronolone and Ben Cotta may have started their own singles feud at DODGEBALL 20. KJohn destroyed Ben right in his face with a newer \"bullet\" ball. That wouldn\u2019t be the first time however as Ben would then get hit in the back of the head later on, courtesy of KJohn once again. Ben\u2019s headshots wouldn\u2019t be the only injuries suffered at DODGEBALL 20 however ...\nTom Adams, easily one of the best around, suffered the same fate as he did at DODGEBALL 9. Tom was guarding the \"rim\" (or \"can\") from oncoming balls when suddenly it hit him ... As he is in mid-air, Ryan Letsche took advantage of the situation and launched a \"bullet\" ball right into the third eldest Adams's \"region\". Tom fell to the ground immediately upon impact and would sit Indian-style for a few good minutes. Special thanks go to Ryan for providing everyone with one of the worst \u201cnut\u201dshots in dodgeball history.\nKJohn took one of the nastiest spills in dodgeball memory. After dodging a ball in mid-air, John would fall hard on the courts, having jumped and spun too high. He landed on the left side of his body, suffering cuts on both his left elbow and ankle. Along with some bruises, one of his toenails was completely torn off as well.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe EXTRA\nThose in attendance got their dose of dodgeball action for the evening after the main match concluded. But a small remainder of players was not ready to quit. The games continued as the Winston Sisters would be opposing captains and new teams would form. Among the remnants were Zach Katz, Alison Bertsch, Kevin Fitzpatrick, John Watters, John Tronolone, Joe Kelly, Chris Daly, Ryan Letsche, Mike \"Sputz\" Krott, and Lenny Herera.\nThis was \"Speed\" Ball. The boundaries were cut in half, as opponents stood no more than 10 feet away from one another. All balls were in play, no matter how many participated. The games went extremely quick as the final score proves that; Lauren\u2019s 5 to Valerie\u2019s 3. This is definitely worth a try for anyone who missed out.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nSPECIAL THANKS\nThanks go to Liz Nogueira and especially Kathryn Nogueira who only came to DODGEBALL 20 to set up the many decorations around the court.\nRyan McCrorey and Dan Spengeman provided video footage for the first time ever. They too are thanked for their efforts.\nRyan McCrorey brought back the radio as well. The music treatment for the evening was energetically fitting.\nDan Karen is thanked for bringing some Hanukkah gifts; several new dodge balls.\nDODGEBALL 20 would not have been a success without all of the players. The second highest attendance ever (tied with DODGEBALL 15) was recorded with an astounding 37 players, just short of DODGEBALL XTWO. Included in the 37 were 3 new players, which means that in 20 outstanding, memorable events, dodgeball has seen the likes of 96 players total.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nAwards, videos, pictures, music, injuries, and more made DODGEBALL 20 truly \"The ClimaXX\". Thank you all for making dodgeball an incredible ride. Pictures of \"The ClimaXX\" will be posted later this week.\nAs we say goodbye to 2005, a new year will usher in a new season of dodgeball ...\nDODGEBALL 21\nJanuary 7th, 2006\n7PM start time\nWall High School",
