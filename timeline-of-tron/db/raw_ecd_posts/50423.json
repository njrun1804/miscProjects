The \"1/2\" count-off was supposed to divide teams as evenly as possible.

How and why the teams became so unmatched is still in question.\nAfter a few trades, the action kicked-off as only it should; fast-paced, heart-pounding intense mayhem as only these teams of all-stars knew. The cold weather combined with rocket bulletballs inflicted much pain onto an enemy. How in the hell \"Sputz\" and \"Fitz\" were able to survive in shorts boggles the mind, and certainly questions their sanity.
