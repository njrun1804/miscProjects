  "body_text": "The XLIV Files\n> Attendance: 28\n> New Players: (4) Dan F, Justin S, Nick W, Ryan S\n> Biggest Return: Wesley Hebrew (Last played at DODGEBALL 17)\n> Lenny Herrera's captain streak ended at DODGEBALL XLIV thanks to rival captain, Welsey Hebrew. The last time Wesley participated in an event was DODGEBALL 17, and interestingly enough, he was captain that night tying with mammouth Matt Larsen 4-4.\n> Human Rims saw a return for the first time since the classic DODGEBALL XL.\n> In a rare happening at XLIV, one dodge ball was lost. It was a blue bulletball and was never found at the conclusion of the event.\nGoing for the Gold: Champ Lenny Herrera vs. Wesley Hebrew!\nMany believe Lenny Herrera to be one of the most contentious captains of all-time as his two prior wins were mired in controversy. But his record stood thus allowing a new challenger to step forward. That challenger immediately indented his name into dodgeball history.\nWesley Hebrew, having not partaken in dodgeball since December event DODGEBALL 17, showed no signs of rustiness. Lenny who has yet to even miss an event since his debut back in early November, put up one hell of fight but was surprisingly no match for his even younger opponent.\nIn what was seemingly a squash match, the re-debuting Wesley Hebrew became\nthe\nman after a grueling three-hour plus match with one Lenny Herrera. The final score to this epic battle was 5 to 1.\n... Lurking in the background, and more so in spirit, was soon-to-return Kevin Adams who had already challenged Lenny to a match at DODGEBALL 45. But now that a new champ has been crowned, what will become of this most unique situation? Will Kevin square off against Wesley at 45?\nModern Marvels\nThere were plenty of top players at DODGEBALL XLIV. In regards to catching, Mike \"Sputz\" has to be on the top of the list. Only few times did the 21-year-old veteran miss a ball. He is without question a key element in Wesley's victory.\nAlso worthy of noting is the now former champ, Lenny Herrera. He is known for his catching ability and did he ever deliver. He fought valiantly throughout the entire event, securing a good number of grabs by night's end.\nRay Marzarella is one of the finest dodgers and blockers in dodgeball today. Those two fundamental skills kept him in games longer than perhaps any other player at XLIV.\nHaving only played a short time, Ryan McCrorey is unquestionably deserving of recognition. In one game, it took at least ten minutes to eliminate the long-time veteran. Dodging left and right, he stood his ground at the front line. After a good 20+ throws, he finally went down much to the relief of his opponents.\nGuts and determination are perfect words when describing Chris Burke. He was fearless in his attempt to play despite not being in top physically condition. With his finger, more so his hand in somesort of cast, one has to respect his amount of courage.\nKevin Fitzpatrick could very well be the standout performer in Season V thus far. His aim for the past few events has been solid, eliminating by the masses each event. Several times during XLIV, he was the last player remaining, usually up against a good number of opponents. Using nothing but raw power and agility, he was able to rack up numerous eliminations despite the numerical disadvantage.\nThe four new male players at DODGEBALL XLIV certainly added more competition. Hopefully they enjoyed themselves and will be making their return to dodge ball at the next outing.\nDODGEBALL 45: His Time is Now\nWith a brand new champ in town, Wesley's road to becoming the greatest captain of all-time has begun.\nHis first challenge is currently unknown, although it has been noted that Kevin Adams reserved the #1 contender's spot at DODGEBALL 45. However, the youngest of the Adams clan was looking to dethrone rival Lenny Herrera. Will Kevin keep his spot as the challenger or step out of contention?\nWhatever the case, Wesley is fully prepared to battle come this Saturday at Wall High School. The story has seen its twists and turns already and will only continue as DODGEBALL 45 approaches.\nAnd not to overlook DODGEBALL 45, the winner of this next captains war will go on to face Sara DeCuir at DODGEBALL 46.\n>>> DODGEBALL 45 ...
