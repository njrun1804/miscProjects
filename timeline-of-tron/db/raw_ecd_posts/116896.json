  "body_text": "Seven Years Ago \u25ac\nSputz and McCrorey were South Belmar roommates ..\nDiana, Megill, & Spenge hadn't yet completed their undergraduate degrees ..\nAvakian happily wore trenchcoats, Chris dressed to impress ..\nStopa enjoyed pajama pants, Travis had half a head of hair  ..\nFitz and Kevin were still teenagers and I wasn't legal to drink ..\nbut dodgeball players?\n\u25ac Seven Years Later ...\n________________________________________\n_________\nThat's how we remember - how we lived - and it's perhaps easier than ever to admit that time surely went fast.\nThink, we're talking seven different calendars have been ripped from our walls and thrown away! But those cherished memories of each passing year remain embedded in our minds and hearts; by their simple thought, we were all motivated to continue this magical journey.\nThis was our collective celebration ..\nseven glorious years in the making\n.\n________________________________________\n_________\n\u2737 How It Came To Be: THE ROAD TO SEVEN\nIn preparation for\nEast Coast Dodgeball\nSEVEN: THE ANNIVERSARY\n, I set out on a viral rampage in an effort to attract as many followers as possible. In July, I began extensive work on a\npromotional video picture collage\nthat became available on August 22 to acclaimed reviews from members of the\nECD\ncommunity and beyond.\nAdditionally, some of my written work shifted from the basic statistical background and embellished storyline-driven posts to more opinionated material to provoke further feedback. An example of the such was evident in the entry entitled\nSeven WONDERS Of OUR WORLD\nwhich nominated past occurrences and players in a \"best of\" type format. Hopefully it was worth reading!\nLastly, the coined \"BIG ONE\" three-vs-three match-up not only had to feature six of the game's most recognized figures, but a\nlegitimate\nreason for the captains' participation\n(see below)\n. One by one, the pre-determined combatants were revealed throughout the week of August 19 to gain interest in the high-stakes contest.\n\u2737 Questions And Answers: PRE-MATCH TRIVIA CONTEST\nI'm always about trying something new and refreshing and felt this was more than suitable. With 84 months worth of facts and stats, why not put them to the test!\nContestants formed at the center line; to the winner, a lifetime supply of bragging rights. In all, it took four measly questions where, in the finale, legendary event general\nRob Avakian outsmarted\nECDElitist\nJustin Wolf\nfor the prized championship.\nThe introductory question quickly eliminated everyone but Avakian and Wolf from contention - perhaps a good 10 or so participants. From there, the last remaining test takers incorrectly answered the next two questions until Avakian scored with the winning remark to secure the higher grade.\nOnline Exclusive!\nQuestion #1: How many \"Act Of Courage\" Award winners are there?\n10\n, 1, 3, 6\nQuestion #2: What is the Wall v. All series score?\n8-6, 7-2,\n8-4\n, 9-2\nQuestion #3: Of the four, who has won more than one Rimshot Contest?\nSpengeman, D. Carty, Stopa,\nDecuir\nQuestion #4: Which player never won at a FAMILY AFFAIR event?\nLondono\n, Teitelbaum, Basista, Vetrano\n\u2737 \"THE BIG ONE\" For A Reason\nIt had to feel special before, during, and after SEVEN and man, did it deliver. These six-person attractions never fail to entertain and excite, especially with such athletic balance between the adversarial squads.\nFor the captains specifically, it may have truly been their final opportunity to grab victory on a premier\nECD\nstage. You had the unpredictable\nRob Avakian\n, the controversial yet tough-as-nails\nDan Turner\n, and the game's finest female all-star\nKelly Oberto\non one side; another array of talents stood in the way comprised of the comedic maniac\nTravis Mills\n, the charismatic dodging extraordinaire\nJoey Smalls\n, and the up-and-coming prodigy\nEamon Fitzpatrick\n. And to think none of them had ever won \"The Big One\" - hence the name!\nThis bout was far from typical or predictable; not once during the night did the lead stretch pass the single point margin. In fact, every round captured was by the trio competing on the East! We've all heard of the \"see-saw match-up\", but this classic encounter absolutely defined it.\nOnce 9:15 rolled around, I had no alternative but to guarantee a victor. As a result, rival captains Smalls and Turner were put under extra pressure in the ninth and final round. If either were eliminited in any form or fashion, the game - and the event - was lost.\nThe Ninth and Final Battle\n.. Turner, with painball in hand, remained in a defensive state for much of the game. His counterpart, however, wasn't as lucky; to his credit, Smalls managed to outlast his entire support system. But the opposition was overwhelming and his chance to regenerate fell into enemy hands.\nAt\nEast Coast Dodgeball\n's unprecedented SEVEN YEAR ANNIVERSARY spectacular,\nRob Avakian, Dan Turner, and Kelly Oberto\ndefeated\nTravis Mills, Joey Smalls, and Eamon Fitzpatrick, 5 - 4\n.\nI cannot express enough gratitude for everyone who competed at this magical showcase. Trust that it really was once in a lifetime.\n\u2737 Along The SEVEN SIDELINES\nSpectators from the nearby tennis area and adjacent basketball court were easily drawn in to this\nECD\npresentation. It wasn't hard to notice the liking to several of the sport's mainstays, most notably the fun-loving Joey Smalls.\nFurthermore, I find it a real treat when our beloved friends stop by even for a brief visit. The dodgeball-formed couple of Pam D'Luhy and Juan Londono as well as the Winston sisters, their brother Jack, and his girlfriend Jill contributed a couple of laughs before the event even commenced. And how could anyone forget about Mr. Fitzpatrick or Michael Edwards' lovely lady Kristen catching the action from the comfort of their cozy chairs.\n\u2737 SEVEN: By The Numbers And The Some\nSEVEN: THE ANNIVERSARY was successfully recorded as the astronomical\none hundred, ninety third (193) spectacular\nduring the\nTronolone Years\nof\nECD\n. It was the 172nd placed on a Saturday.\nDue to the continued reconstruction of the Wall High School courts, the beloved\nOcean Road Park\nbattle zone became the choice setting for the second consecutive\nECD\ngathering and 24th time overall.\nTotal attendance equalled\ntwenty-eight (28)\nstrong. This terrific turnout was the highest recorded since the 5 YEAR ANNIVERSARY in 2010 and on par with CALL OF DUTY in July 2012.\nTwenty-three (23) male competitors\nwas the largest number since the same five year exravaganza in 2010.\nThe 3-vs-3 war was only the sixth such match in\nECD\nhistory. Of the six combatants, only Mills and Avakian had previous experience in a similar main event (150 and CXV, respectively). Captains statistics are as follows: Mills 0-3-1, Smalls 1-5-0, Fitzpatrick 1-2-0, Avakian 3-3-0, Turner 2-1-1. and Oberto 1-1-0. It should be noted that several other\nECD\nnames were approached including Sara DeCuir, Derek Carty, and Michelle Mullins. Kenny Jacobs, who had originally accepted, was unable to attend.\nAn astounding\n19 dodge balls\n-\n16 bulletballs, 2 painballs, and 1 foam football\n- were hurled throughout the duration of SEVEN. Kevin Fitzpatrick set up two large fences on both sides of the battlegrounds .. not a single dodge ball went missing!\nThe official event anthem was \"I Melt With You\" by Modern English. This now timeless theme song was featured in the promotional video leading up the annual affair.\nHow fitting that at SEVEN,\nseven new players\ncompeted for the very first time: Ben Barry (#498), Elijah Watkins (#499), Jack Mallett (#500), John Commesso (#501), Leandro Bongiovanni (#502), Nick Perone (#503), and Robert Johnson (#504).\nAnd yes, history was indeed made when the\n500th Player\nwas carved in the annals of\nECD\n\u25ac\n________________________________________\n_________\nAs I've said before, I've been able to do exactly what I've wanted the last seven years and it's because of your dedication and trust in me and each other that\nEast Coast Dodgeball\nhas traveled this far. I hope you enjoyed every ounce of SEVEN: THE ANNIVERSARY.\nFor anyone interested in viewing two special picture albums, check out the pages below:\n\u2737 Pictures courtesy Dan Spengeman can be seen\nHERE\n\u2737 Pictures courtesy Rob Knott and John Tronolone can be seen\nHERE",
