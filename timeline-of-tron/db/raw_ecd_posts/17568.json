He worked on it for 20 hours straight beginning from last Friday afternoon and concluding around midday Saturday.\nThe documentary itself is said to be outstanding, and very professionally done. Interviews, action, comedy, and more are compiled into this 45 minute DVD. It is a must watch for anyone associated with dodgeball, past or present.\n\"Diana's Dodgeball Dinner\" just got a hell of lot better. What better way to start DODGEBALL XXV weekend than with a \"pasta party\" and a viewing of the first dodgeball documentary ever made.\nThis is definitely \"Not JUST a Game\".",
