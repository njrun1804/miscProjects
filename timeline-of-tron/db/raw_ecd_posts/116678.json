  "body_text": "I've Got QUESTIONS, You've Got ANSWERS!\nIt's been an enduring, physical struggle the last half decade-plus. So brace yourself for an equally-challenging mental test during\nECD\n's pre-match attraction\nTrivia Contest\n- only at\nECD\n's 7th birthday party!\nLuck Has It: SEVEN RAFFLE!\nA mystery prize package is up for grabs and it may just have your name on it!\nThe Numerical Pinnacle: WHO'S #500?\nECD\nneeds just three more - who, if anyone, will become the  unprecedented\n500th Player\n?\n\"THE BIG ONE\": Six-Person Showdown!\nEvery great court general has risen high above the occasion to capture the coveted victory. For those brave and fortunate souls, bragging rights for life indeed. But it remains that only an elite few have done so on the grandest, most crucial stage of all.\nThe magnificently star-studded, three-vs-three encounter at SEVEN is a rare, once-in-a-lifetime chance for those who have yet to taste such sweet triumph.\nUndeniably, SEVEN will host \"The Big One\" as six of the game's most recognized figures -\nMILLS, AVAKIAN, JACOBS, SMALLS, OBERTO, TURNER\n- are carefully divided into two formidible squads, each with one goal in mind.\nTravis MILLS\nFormer two-time season finale headliner \"Maniac\" Mills has virtually done it all, with just this one exception. His comedic, good-humored antics have yet to bring him that figurative trophy; will he be able to contain his contagious laugh long enough to grab the career-enhancing win?\nECD\nPlayer #23\nDebut: DODGEBALL DAY 2 | September 4, 2005\nNotable Contest(s): Defeated at DODGEBALL XL versus Joey Kelly; also fought to a draw at DODGEBALL 150's \"Battle of the Sexes\" three-vs-three confrontation\nCaptains Record: 0-2-1.\nJoey SMALLS\nHis showcases against Sascha Basista throughout the years were as memorable as they were hurtful. Unfortunately for this fun-loving legend, the accurately nicknamed \"Eddie Gordo\" remains without that prized brass ring. SEVEN is perhaps his final opportunity and bet that he will stop at nothing to attain it.\nECD\nPlayer #218\nDebut: DODGEBALL 65 | November 26, 2006\nNotable Contest(s): Defeated at FAMILY AFFAIR III (2010) versus Sascha Basista\nCaptains Record: 1-4-0.\nKenny JACOBS\nHe's the resident newbie who quickly ascended the rungs of\nECD's\nladder. In his almost two-year journey, the all-around athletic all-star Jacobs earned a spot in the FAMILY AFFAIR spotlight in 2011, though his victory-seeking quest was ultimately denied. At SEVEN, his second go-around amidst the familiar atmosphere might just be his crowning achievement.\nECD\nPlayer #462\nDebut: 5 YEAR ANNIVERSARY (175) | September 11, 2010\nNotable Contest(s): Defeated at FAMILY AFFAIR IV (2011) versus Bobby Vetrano\nRecord: 0-1-0.\nRob AVAKIAN\nThis rare, but certainly appreciated appearance at SEVEN couldn't be any more crucial for the formerly-known \"Trenchcoat\". While Avakian holds the most match victories amongst his captains counterparts, none of which have come at such a high-profile event. Will his unpredictable, offensive strategy lead him to the career defining moment he's yearned?\nECD\nPlayer #60\nDebut: DODGEBALL 8 | October 22, 2005\nNotable Contest(s): Defeated in \"The War To Settle The Scores\", three-vs-three war at DODGEBALL CXV\nRecord: 2-3-0.\nDan TURNER\nOne of\nECD's\nmost controversial figures in all of its illustrious history. Orginally slated as one-half of the THREE YEAR ANNIVERSARY's main attraction eons ago, Turner, for reasons unknown, no-showed the historic event! This wouldn't be the first time he pulled the disappearance act either, a dubious legacy still conversed about to this very day. There is absolutely no question that this Pond Scum icon is indeed the \"wild card\" in SEVEN.\nECD\nPlayer #117\nDebut: DODGEBALL XXVIII | February 25, 2006\nNotable Contest(s): SEVEN will be his first big-time main event\nRecord: 1-1-1.\nKelly OBERTO\nThis chick means business. Guaranteed,  her ultra-athletic background will be unleashed for the\nECD\ncommunity to witness and it won't be pretty. Arguably the most well-rounded competitor of the SEVEN cast, her lone defeat at the hands of\nECDElitist\nDiana DiBuccio in July '11 will only add fuel to the fire.\nECD\nPlayer #356\nDebut: DODGEBALL 119 | December 29, 2007\nNotable Contest(s): SEVEN will be her first big-time main event\nRecord: 0-1-0.\n________________________________________\n________________________\nWe've Done It, Again.\nAnd Luck Had Nothing To Do With It.\nSEVEN Magical Years Are Ours.\nSEVEN: THE ANNIVERSARY\nSeptember 1, 2012 | 5:30PM\nOcean Road Park",
