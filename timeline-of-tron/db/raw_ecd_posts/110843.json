  "body_text": "\"For two thousand, one hundred, sixty nine agonizing days,\nthe\nEast Coast Dodgeball\nempire has been in a state of civil war.\"\nSTAR WARS\nis the 184th\nEast Coast Dodgeball\nevent produced within the \"Tronolone Era.\" It is scheduled to take place on August 13, 2011 at the Wall High School tennis courts in Wall, New Jersey. There is currently one attraction announced for the event.\nPRODUCTION\nSTAR WARS will feature one main event that involves members of the current\nEast Coast Dodgeball\nroster from existing rivalries partly initiated by embellished storylines. Dodgeball players will portray as themselves in an intensified manner as they follow through a series of outings that build tension and culminate in a duel, commonly known as a \"captains match.\"\nSCHEDULED MATCH\nJustin Pierce, Valerie Winston, Kevin Fitzpatrick\nvs.\nChris Adams, Lauren Winston, Michael Edwards\n\u25ba Stipulation: Every third game will be competed under the once-named \"secret captains\" rule which means if either Winston is eliminated, the round is lost for that entire team [regardless of the number of in-play participants].\nBACKGROUND\nThe predominant rivalry for the ladies began on September 3, 2005, when sisters Valerie and Lauren Winston met at the inaugural\nECD\nevent in a one-on-one captains match-up. As of August 1, 2011, they have faced an additional four times - 2006's\nONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY\nand\nHoliday Special\nevents, the\nTWO YEAR ANNIVERSARY\nin 2007, and last year's\n5 YEAR ANNIVERSARY\n- with each winning twice and tying once to bring the score to a deadlocked 2-2-1 draw. A sixth and perhaps final encounter between the two was formally announced on July 16, 2011. They will each be aligned by two male partners of The Writer's choosing.\nThe other main conflict heading into STAR WARS will see Kevin Fitzpatrick and Justin Pierce team with Valerie to take on Michael Edwards and Chris Adams, who will join Lauren. Several points of interest are noted:\n\u25ba The Adams-Fitzpatrick rivalry has been well-documented with each battling one another on three separate occasions: the 2006 year-end finale\nDODGEBALL 70\n, the overtime\nCREAMation\nthriller\nDODGEBALL 105, and late-2007's malicious\nDODGEBALL CXV\n.\n\u25ba Edwards and Fitzpatrick will meet for the second time following Edwards' team victory over Fitzpatrick's team at DODGEBALL 100.\n\u25ba Edwards and Pierce will face each other for the first time ever. They were, however, co-captains at\nDODGEBALL 100\nin August 2007.\n\u25ba Despite competing in excess of 140 events individually, Adams and Pierce have never faced in any kind of captains confrontation.\n\u25ba The Adams-Edwards and Fitzpatrick-Pierce duos will each join forces for the first time after a pair of high-profile matches. Pierce met Fitzpatrick in the inaugural three-vs-three captains encounter at DODGEBALL 100 while Adams battled Edwards at the 4 YEAR ANNIVERSARY, an event held within the 2009 \"Adams Era\" of\nECD\n.\n\u25ba None of the male co-captains have either faced or teamed with their female counterparts.\nSTARRING\nAdams, Christopher\n: Premiere legend, de facto chancellor during the 2009\nECD\nera.\nDebuted at DODGEBALL DAY 3; Inducted into\nECDElite\nHall of Fame September 11, 2010.\nEdwards, Michael\n: Iconic crazy man, sole survivor of the dreaded 2006 summer.\nDebuted at DODGEBALL 47; Inducted into\nECDElite\nHall of Fame November 27, 2010.\nFitzpatrick, Kevin\n: Feared powerhouse, The Writer's top combatant of the modern age.\nDebuted at DODGEBALL XTWO; Inducted into\nECDElite\nHall of Fame September 11, 2010.\nPierce, Justin\n: Respected court general, multi-time award recipient.\nDebuted at DODGEBALL DAY 2; Inducted into\nECDElite\nHall of Fame September 11, 2010.\nWinston, Lauren\n: Famed framer of\nEast Coast Dodgeball\n.\nDebuted at DODGEBALL DAY 1; Inducted into\nECDElite Family\nwing of the Hall of Fame, November 27, 2010.\nWinston, Valerie\n: Famed framer of\nEast Coast Dodgeball\n.\nDebuted at DODGEBALL DAY 1; Inducted into\nECDElite Family\nwing of the Hall of Fame, November 27, 2010.\nSUPPORTING CAST\nAdams, Kevin\n: 2010\nECDElite\ninductee.\nAdams, Steve\n: 2x season finale headliner.\nBasista, Sascha\n: FAMILY AFFAIR III headliner.\nDiBuccio, Diana\n: 2010\nECDElite\ninductee.\nJacobs, Kenny\n: FAMILY AFFAIR IV headliner.\nKatz, Zach\n: Future SIX YEAR ANNIVERSARY headliner.\nKnott, Rob\n: 2011\nECD\nphotographer.\nLibrizzi, Kris\n: Rookie sensation of 2011.\nLima, Joanice\n: Rookie sensation of 2011.\nMegill, Kevin\n: 2010\nECDElite\ninductee.\nMills, Travis\n: 2x season finale headliner.\nOberto, Kelly\n: Rookie sensation of 2011.\nStopa, Lauren\n: 2011\nECDElite\ninductee.\nTeitelbaum, Jason\n: FAMILY AFFAIR II headliner.\nTronolone, John\n: 2011\nECDElite\ninductee.\nWolf, Justin\n: Future SIX YEAR ANNIVERSARY headliner.\nWriter, The\n: Behind-the-scenes mastermind and events planner of\nECD\n.\nEXTERNAL LINKS\n\u25ba\nSTAR WARS Facebook event page\n\u25ba\nEast Coast Dodgeball\nFacebook page",
