Perhaps the awards at DODGEBALL 30 will be remembered as some of the funniest and most memorable.\n> Powerhouse Thrower Award <\nALISON BERTSCH\n> \"Allied Powers\" Awards <\n*Best Tag Teams*\nLAUREN FREDA and VALERIE WINSTON\nTRAVIS MILLS and STEVE ADAMS\n> \"Hot Hands\" Catcher Award <\nLENNY HERRERA\n> \"Terminator\" Award <\n*Most Violent Shots*\nMIKE \"SPUTZ\" KROTT\n> \"High Jump\" Award <\nDEREK CARTY\n> \"Deflection Defense\" Award <\n*Best Blocker*\nKEVIN MEGILL JR.\n> Perfect Attendance <\nLENNY HERRERA\n> \"Prove Me Wrong\" Award <\n*Most Improved Player*\nLAUREN WINSTON\n> Appreciation Awards <\nDAN SPENGEMAN\nKATHRYN NOGUIERA\nIn a bit of mystery, there was one more award to given. However, that will remain a secret ... for now.\nTwo unexpected awards were given to John Tronolone simply out of appreciation.\n> Dan Spengeman presented John with PhotoShop, thus to help him with his many dodgeball posters.\n> Chris Adams secretly gave John a WWF New York video game token, a token in which Chris carried around in his wallet every single day.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe PLAYERS\nAs if he needed to be mentioned, Chris Adams showed once again that he is a true veteran and one of the all-time greats. What an arm the eldest Adams brother has, eliminating many opponents throughout the afternoon. He might have secured the catch of the day too with an impressive diving catch thrown by \"The Creation\" himself, John Tronolone\nThe comedic duo of Travis Mills and Steve Adams were at it again. They eliminated their share of players, including one of the most shocking, but certainly hilarious ones. Steve decided to go for \"rim\", lofting a ball high into the air. The last remaining player on the opposing side was John Tronolone. Ready to catch, John completely missed the slow-moving \"missile\" launched by Steve. The miss could be attributed to John holding two \"bullet\" balls. A sad miss for John but a memorable game-winner for Steve.\nMichael Tronolone, younger brother of John, had some nice catches during 30. Many of those were actually enemy deflections from fellow teammates. A major catch came from out of no where, when Mike jumped high into the air and caught a ball thrown by none other than John Watters.\nChip Terhune also had some impressive catches during this milestone event. He debuted at DODGEBALL 21 and has easily been a key factor each time he steps onto the court.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe MATCH\nMr. \"Deflection Defense\" Kevin Megill and \"The Creation\" John Tronolone squared off at the biggest event in history.\nThe games went back and forth; at first. But towards the end, Kevin took the lead, a lead he would hold for the remainder of DODGEBALL 30. Around the mid-way point, it was tied at four. By the end of 30, the score would see a drastic change ... Kevin with nine and John still with four.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe RECORDS\n> Attendance: 34 (Fourth highest behind XTWO, 15, 20)\n> DODGEBALL 30 marked the third straight time an event had 30 or more in attendance.\n> Biggest Return: Nick Peros (Last Played at DODGEBALL XONE)\n> Other Major Returns:\nTyler Walliker (Last played at DODGEBALL XTWO)\nMike \"Rozz\" Rosinski (Last played at DODGEBALL 18)\nJim Martin (Last played at DODGEBALL 20)\nKathryn Nogueira (Last played at DODGEBALL 20)\nLiz Nogueira (Last played at DODGEBALL 21)\n> New Players: (3) Cliff Yannone, Michael Tronolone, and Scotty Ratcliffe.\n> New youngest player at DODGEBALL 30: Scotty Ratcliffe at age three.\n> Video footage made its return for the first time since DODGEBALL 23.\n> A new \"Dodgeball Board\" debuted at DODGEBALL 30, created by Ryan McCrorey.\n> DODGEBALL 30 marked the first time John Tronolone did not wear one of his imfamous WWE Wrestling shirts.\n> For the third time in his career, John Tronolone would be captain. His last runs were at DODGEBALL 9 and DODGEBALL 20. Kevin Megill was previously captain at DODGEBALL TWENTY-SIX, so it was the second time for him.\n> The loss to Kevin Megill at DODGEBALL 30 marked the third loss for John as a captain. His \"perfect\" record moves \"up\" to 0-3. *He lost to Chris Adams at DODGEBALL 9 and Jim Martin at DODGEBALL 20*\n> Diana DiBuccio and Steve Adams remain on top of the \"Most Events Played\" list. Chris Adams moves up to third alone.\n> DODGEBALL 30 ... \"Wet War VI\" ... The fourth \"Wet War\" in \"Season 3\".\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe PICTURES\nThe complete set of pictures taken from DODGEBALL 30 will be posted later in the week.
