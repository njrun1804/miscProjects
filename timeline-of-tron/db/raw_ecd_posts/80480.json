After all, he's already taken down each of his teammates-turned-rivals in both one-on-one and team brawls. But the \"Light and Agile\" Award winner has yet to taste defeat in his illustrious career - Butler, Carty, Megill among others have at one time or another fallen to this iconic figure.\nFlash Results by Game\n:\nEdwards victorious 5 to 2\nMarzarella: 4, 7\nEdwards: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6\nA straight-shooting, no nonsense collision between former allies is what was on the card - and those that witnessed this spectacle can tell you first hand that's exactly what they got.\nEdwards took the early lead in this heated debate. After an hour of heart-pounding, body-bruising mayhem, \"The Crazy One\" racked up two more, already signaling the demise of his longtime \"friend\". Even the individual eliminations favored \"The Crazy One\"! Though a loss appeared imminent, Marzarella refused to go down without a fight, securing two points much to his credit by the 10:30 mark.\nMoments & Stars\n: Chris Adams and Robert Brown's bulletballs fiercely colliding; several players hilariously pretending to be zombies, most notably Diana DiBuccio; Rob Nieratko's insanely wicked headshot on\nteammate\nChris Adams; Sascha Basista collapsing following a most painful nutshot from, you guessed it, Chris \"The Axe\" Adams\nRECORDS\n> Attendance: 24\n> Notable Returns: Gerald Lewis (last competed at DB 103); Rob Nieratko (last competed at DB 108); Ryan McCrorey (last competed at DB 116)\n> New Players: (1) James Ahern\n- One thing certainly worth nothing was the absence of the radio.\n- Captains Ray Marzarella and Mike Edwards competed under\nGodMode Rules\n, first seen [and created on the spot] by birthday boys Lenny Herrera and Mike \"Sputz\" Krott at\nDODGEBALL 85\n.\n- In the main event, Edwards would go on to defeat Marzarella, 5 to 2.
