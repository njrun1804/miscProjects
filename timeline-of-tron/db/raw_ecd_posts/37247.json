Just like Last Week!\nDODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO started off with a surprise. Neither challenging captains, Ray Marzarella nor Dan Turner, attended the event. The absences of course left four-time champion Kevin Adams without an opponent.\nAnd so for the third straight event, the now-classic wooden rims built by last week's rimshot contest winner Ryan Letsche, provided for yet another elimination style contest.\nDODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO's rimshot competition included, as always, the finest of competitors: Valerie Winston, Kurt Gassner, Derek Carty, Steve Adams, Ryan McCrorey, Ryan Letsche, Chris Adams, and Diana DiBuccio.\nIn somewhat of a shocker, Ryan Letsche for the second week in a row earned the #1 contender's position, earning his rematch with the champ. He was the only competitor to even hit the rim.\nRyan Letsche vs. Kevin Adams II\nIt's perhaps the best friendly rivalry ever, pitting two outstanding dodgeball atheletes against one another. After a 5 to 2 loss just last week, you can bet Ryan Letsche was looking for redemption.\nThe beginning of DODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO mirrored that of DODGEBALL 51, rewarding Letsche with the event's first win. The next few games would prove to be the most pivotal as the team that held the lead was likely to keep it.\nKevin trailed by only one up until the concluding game. With a mere 30 minutes left, the score read 6 to 5 in favor of the challenger.\nIn a close encounter, the end result of DODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO witnessed the emergence of a brand new captains champion. Ryan Letsche, in his second bout with Kevin Adams, defeated the young sensation by a slim margin, 7 to 5. Kevin, had he won, would have set several all-time records.\nRyan Letsche defeated Kevin Adams, 7 - 5, to become the new champion.\n... The story does not end there ...\nAs per a prematch agreement, whomever came out the winner would \"retire\" the captains crown. Captains for future events will now be chosen in several ways, including the popular rimshot contests. Check back later in the week for more information regarding future captains matches.\nPain and Power ... It must be the Powerade\nThere were two outstanding performances at DODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO. For the men, it was the insane Ryan McCrorey. For the ladies, the show-stealing Lauren Stopa.\n- Ryan McCrorey has established a legacy for himself through hardwork, persistence, and heart. In regards to DODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO, the early stages of such an event saw him eliminate just about every single opponent. Usually when an accomplishment like this happens, it takes at least ten minutes. Ryan however did it in record time, taking out a good eight or nine bodies in less than three minutes. Much to his credit, he even secured several game winners.\n- A player who underestimates her own ability showed that she is among the elite. Perhaps even she does not know just how good she is. For Lauren Stopa, one of her finer plays came seconds after claiming \"I can't hit the rim\". Of course, the exact opposite happened allowing for a full team regeneration. One cannot take away the amount of players she also eliminated either.\nIf there were two other notable players, they would be Melissa Kerr and Kurt Gassner. They have certainly been getting a lot of attention in recent weeks, and their athelitism certainly proves that. They are easily among the best all-around performers dodgeball has ever seen.\nRecords of FIFTY-TWO\n- Attendance: 21\n- New Players: 0\n- Biggest Return: Alison Bertsch (Last Played at DODGEBALL 47)\n- DODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO was \"Wet War XI\".\n- Ryan Letsche won his second out of only three rimshot contests. Letsche's win proved to be crucial as his captains record stands at an even\n500\nof 2 - 2.\n- Kevin Adams, despite a loss, still managed to tie a record: 6 times captain (along with his brother Steve). His captains record is 4 - 2.\n- Much like DODGEBALL 51, the wooden rims returned.\n- Three new dodge balls were introduced; a yellow painball and two Superman bulletballs. A thank you to Ryan Letsche.\n- An \"Opponent Alliance\" was again witnessed at DODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO. The same two men that made the agreement the first time were at it again: Tom Adams and John Tronolone. The same thing happened at DODGEBALL 50.\nWhere does Dodgeball go from here?\nDODGEBALL 53/FIFTY-THREE is a unique event to say the least.\nI. Before the event even begins, a Poster Contest is planned. There are currently three designs ready to be unvailed. For those that would still like to enter, submit your design(s) to Undertaker13yrs@aol.com. The deadline is Tuesday, August 22.\nII. Not even the writer of dodgeball knows who the captains will be for the upcoming event. With the captains championship officially defunct, a new \"system\" will perhaps emerge. The rimshot contests have certainly added some fun for players, so definitely expect more of those. There will be a story about an idea called \"Featured Matches\" discussed in the DODGEBALL 53/FIFTY-THREE preview later this week.\nDODGEBALL 54 Reminder!\nPlease remember that the One Year Anniversary of dodgeball is on a Sunday. It's an event that\nmust\ntake place at Ocean Road Park seeing how dodgeball began there. Start time is at 6pm, so please be on time. It would be appreciated if anyone could come early to help setup.
