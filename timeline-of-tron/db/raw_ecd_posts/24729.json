  "body_text": "There is no need to rush with the results of the past weekend's two colossal events. So in this first part, you will simply get the stories of both events. The records portion will come later in the week.\nDODGEBALL XXX4\n\"Change\" is a word many admit to fearing. But with dodgeball, \"change\" doesn't always have to be a bad thing. The week prior to DODGEBALL XXX4, ideas came about with the formation of teams using a more random set-up. Those who heard about the ideas felt \"What is there to lose?\". The answer to that was nothing. After all, DODGEBALL 35 would take place just two days later.\nThe start of XXX4 came with drawing of numbers; either 1 or 2. Those with 1 formed one team and the same with players holding a 2. But in a hidden twist, there were also two \"Captain\" cards. This would add even more to the whole set-up of the teams. Those holding the \"Captain\" cards then chose which of the already formed armies they would like to lead in battle.\nThe two \"Captains\", who interestingly squared off in the \"Ultimate Poster Contest\" back in March, were Dan Spengeman and Justin Pierce.\nJustin decided to side with the \"1s\". Dan obviously went with his team, the \"2s\". But all was not said and done. Trades then came from each team. After a good number of trades, most notably with Lenny Herrera and Ryan McCrorey, the final assemblies were ready to fight ...\nRevenge was on Dan's mind after his defeat in the \"Ultimate Poster Contest\" a couple of weeks ago. But \"The Piercer\" has never backed down from a fight: a war for the ages to say the least.\nTo the surprise of many, both teams were very evenly matched. Many were concerned that the random arrangement of teams would cause a bit of unbais, but that was certainly not the case.\nThe pursuit of victory waged on into the late hours of evening. With a tie score, the final encounter was a must. In the end, \"Quick Sand\" Dan avenged his loss in the poster contest, taking home the captain's win. \"The Piercer\" put up one hell of an effort and went out like a true champion.\nDan Spengeman defeats Justin Pierce (4 to 3).\n..........\nLenny Herrera proved to the world that he can do more than just catch. Along with his teammates, his arm was his closest ally as he sent a good number of players to the sidelines.\nA returning Sara Decuir is without question one of the most dominant players ever. She caught the easiest of thorws, as well as the hardest, even using her fingernails on a few occasions. Her talents round out with both extreme dodges and forceful throws, making her a destruction machine.\nAnother fierce female also made a splash. Having only played one other time, Melanie Wooley demonstrated she too is a top female. She outlasted many players on her team, which saw the removal of her opposition many a time. Watch out for Melanie; she will fight to the finish.\nLauren Stopa has been attending more events than she has in the past. Because of it, she is improving on a week-to-week basis, strategically approaching the line, firing at will. She was a key player in several games at XXX4, sending members of the opposing team to the elimination line. There is no stopping Lauren Stopa; she is on the rise.\nA bit of a scare ensued with the faceshot on one Christina Guarino. It was a \"pain\" ball shot felt around the world, literally stopping the competition. The \"perpetrator\" was that of Zach Katz, perhaps the hardest throwing \"pain\" baller at the present time. Thankfully, Christina was okay, but would sit out for the rest of the event.\n________________________________________\n_________________\nDODGEBALL 35\nOcean Road Park, the birthplace of dodgeball, would host this 35th installment. Coming off the heels of DODGEBALL XXX4, there was no telling what to expect. To say that those who participated at XXX4 were physcially sore from that very event would be an understatement. A large portion of the 26 in attendance expressed and shared their pain with fellow competitors. But the one guarantee is that of a single word: \"fun\".\nBefore the event began, John Tronolone approached Kevin Fiztpatrick asking him if he would consider being captain. Kevin's quick response was \"Only if you are.\" The match was set instantly.\nBoth Fitz and John have a very storied history. The day of Fitz's debut saw him emerge as an incredible throwing machine, with each throw packed with atomic bomb like force. From then on, Fitz has admitted to enjoy his rivalry with the self-proclaimed \"Sexy Beast\", aiming for him countless times at past events. With both men as captain, a feud of this calliber could only become bigger.\nHaving never won a captains battle, what better way to end that losing streak than with a victory over arguably your biggest rival. John has gone 0 and 3 at past events, losing at events 9, 20, and 30. Fitz on the other hand destroyed Zach Katz at DODGEBALL 19, earning him bragging rights. An easy victory right?\nWhat looked to be a very easy victory turned out to the complete opposite. It was clear John formed the strongest of allies, with proof of the final score of six to two. Some view the defeat of Fitz as an upset, seeing how John's passed captains record is awful. Whatever the case maybe, the feud will continue for sure.\n..........\nLong-time veteran Diana DiBuccio has plenty of gas left in the tank. Known mainly as a catcher, she proved that assumption true. \"Bullet and \"pain\" balls were rifled at the 21 year-old throughout the entire event. She stopped a good majority of them.\nA broken limb is one taken seriously in all athletic outings. For Matt Brown, a physical injury that put him out of action for several weeks, made his return to dodgeball that much sweeter. Admitting to a bit of soreness before the start of 35, Matt would become even more recognized of his toughness and heart. Keep in mind, he is one of the youngest players ever, competiting in his mid-teens.\nKevin Fitz added a new talent rarely seen before in his repertoire: catching. Like the young Matt Brown, he is not in top physical condition because of a recent left shoulder surgery. But he somehow pulled off many grabs during the afternoon, certainly worthy of being noted.\nIn a final thought from 35, the extreme Ryan McCrorey hit three \"rim\" shots at DODGEBALL 35. Since the start of the new season, Ryan has been an important and key player perhaps like no other.\n________________________________________\n_________________\n>> The records portion, like already mentioned, will be posted in Part II of \"DOUBLE Your FUN\".\n>> Mark your calenders for the second half of \"Season 3\"!!!\nSaturday, April 22nd ~ DODGEBALL 36\nFriday, April 28th ~ DODGEBALL 37\nSaturday, May 6th ~ DODGEBALL 38\n>> Rising concerns over location will play perhaps the biggest role in the future of dodgeball.
