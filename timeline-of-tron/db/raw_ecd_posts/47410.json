As the high-flyin' Derek Carty dodged a bullet from Mike \"Sputz\", Lauren was met with the bulletball instead, sending the female titan off to the sidelines instantly. It was thought her finger to be broken, or at the least dislocated. It is currently unknown what the effects of such a hit have caused, but Lauren is wished the best of luck.\nMelissa Kerr and Sascha Basista were also on the receiving end of a dreaded faceshot.
