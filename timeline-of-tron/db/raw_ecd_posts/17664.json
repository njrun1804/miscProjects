  "body_text": "\"I am driving Alison and Lenny for tonight's party. I will not be driving anyone else, but have no problem with anyone following me. If anyone is lost on directions, simply meet me at Wall High School by 6:30, in which peeps can follow me to Diana's house from there. If anyone can not make it at that time, then give either me or Diana a call and we'll give you the directions. My cell, although not in the greatest of shape, is 908-433-8798. Diana's number is probably best to call: 609-977-0950. Hope to see everyone there!\"\nJOHN TRONOLONE\nFebruary 3rd, 2006\n1:54AM",
