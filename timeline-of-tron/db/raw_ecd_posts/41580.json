It was only fitting that the final return match before DODGEBALL LX was as big as they come with multi-time award winners and rivals since the days of old, Chris Adams and John Tronolone. Could John pull off the big upset, defeating his nemesis nearly one year after their first encounter? Or would Chris remain on top of the mountain?\nROUND 2: Chris Adams vs. John Tronolone\nIt was the rematch of the century as two of the most dominant warriors to ever set foot on the dodgeball court collided for a second time!\nIt had to be the most evenly-matched captains battle in recent memory. The first six games were split down the middle at three apiece. With the latter games, little had changed as both teams earned victories; a true see-saw match.  It wasn't until the final hour where John, alongside an array of talented performers, became nearly unstoppable, besting their ruthless opponents. The score went from 6 - 6 to 10 - 6, in favor of Tronolone. John Tronolone had done what he had failed to do at DODGEBALL 9, defeating his Season 1 rival Chris Adams in one of the biggest upsets of the year.\nJohn Tronolone defeated Chris Adams in their second encounter at DODGEBALL LIX, 10 to 6.\nChris's Key Allies\n--> Mike \"Sputz\": The catching machine couldn't have been hotter, catching nearly every ball thrown his way. Few will ever forget his amazing \"hat\" catch which sent the athletic Mike Edwards to the sidelines.\n--> Rob Avakian: Sometimes referred to as \"Sharp\", the \"Hot Hands Catcher\" award winner put on an all-star performance. The wreckless dodger eliminated a number of opponents with his accuracy.\nJohn's Key Allies\n--> Kevin Adams: He perhaps caught just as much as \"Sputz\", more so when enemies aimed for the rim. Using his height, he sent enemies packing allowing an ally to return to action.\n--> Kevin Megill: He is usually one of the last to be eliminated and many view him as a great \"life-saving\" player with an array of talents, notably his power and catching.\nLIX Extras!\nDODGEBALL LIX featured the most powerful and ruthless competitors ever. Add in the fact that it was cooler than previous weeks only increased certain pain.\n--- Ryan Letsche was left with a huge red mark on his lower-back/hip area thanks to one Chris Adams.\n--- Tom Adams was carried off the court thanks to an insane thigh shot by Kevin Megill.\nROUND 2 Records\n- Attendance: 22\n- Biggest Return: Wesley Hebrew (Last played at DODGEBALL 50)\n- New Players: (2) Chris Rible and Ryan Webber\n- The Letsche-made wooden rims returned for the first time since DODGEBALL 53.\n- Sixteen games were played in all; one of the highest recorded numbers ever.\n- Alison Bertsch and Diana DiBuccio were the only two women to partake in DODGEBALL LIX.\n- Chris Adams suffered his first singles loss. John Tronolone picked up only his second win. Chris's record is 3-2; John's record is 2-4.\n- John Tronolone tied the record for the most number of times as captain with 6.
