  "body_text": "Nearly one year after the first ten-event occured, it is still unreal just how successful dodgeball remains. It has been a roller coaster ride throughout the past 9 weeks and on October 21, the culmination of everyone's dedication, hardwork, and desire truly paid off. Celebrate the event that was \"The SuperBowl of Dodgeball\", DODGEBALL LX ...\n- ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ -\nTHE AWARDS\nBroken fingers, crafty new stars, and so much more truly re-did the sport in the past month or so. Here are the categories and winners at \"The SuperBowl of Dodgeball\".\nAppreciation Award\nGiven to those individuals who contributed to dodgeball, on and/or off the court.\n--> Recipient at DODGEBALL LX:\nAimee Savoth\nPast winners: Ryan McCrorey at DODGEBALL 20, Kathryn Nogueira and Dan Spengeman at DODGEBALL 30, Kevin Megill and Justin Pierce at DODGEBALL XL, and Dan Karen, Ryan Letsche, Diana DiBuccio, and Carol DiBuccio at DODGEBALL 50.\nUltimate Appreciation Award\nGiven to those individuals who contributed to dodgeball, but have already received the Appreciation Award.\n--> Recipient at DODGEBALL LX:\nKathryn Nogueira\nKathryn is the first winner of this newly-created award.\nPowerhouse Thrower Award\nGiven to only the hardest throwers in the sport.\n--> Recipient at DODGEBALL LX:\nJim Butler\nPast winners include Mike Rosinski and Chris Adams at DODGEBALL X, Kevin Fitzpatrick and John Watters at DODGEBALL 20, Alison Bertsch at DODGEBALL 30, and Kevin Megill at DODGEBALL XL.\nPainball Powerhouse Thrower Award\nA version of the famed Powerhouse Thrower Award, this is given strictly to those who throw one of the larger painballs perhaps harder than anyone.\n--> Recipient at DODGEBALL LX:\nJustin Pierce\nThe only past winner of this award is Zach Katz at DODGEBALL 50.\n\"Hot Hands\" Catcher Award\nGiven to an individual who has shown tremendous catching ability.\n--> Recipient at DODGEBALL LX:\nMike \"Sputz\" Krott\nPast winners include Lenny Herrera at DODGEBALL 30 and Rob \"Sharp\" Avakian at DODGEBALL XL.\nLight and Agile (\"L.A.\") Dodger Award\nGiven to an individual known for outstanding dodging ability.\n--> Recipient at DODGEBALL LX:\nMike Edwards\nThere have been other dodging awards given from time to time, but Mike is the first winner of this newly-created award.\nProdigy Award\nGiven to standout players that are much younger than that of their competition.\n--> Recipients at DODGEBALL LX:\nAndrew DeSarno, Chris Yoda\nThe only past winners of this award are Matt Brown and Lenny Herrera at DODGEBALL 20.\nAct of Courage Award\nGiven to a competitor who participated with any serious injury.\n--> Recipients at DODGEBALL LX:\nJim Martin, Diana DiBuccio, Dan Spengeman, Alexandra Ratcliffe\nPast winners include Kevin Adams at DODGEBALL 20, and Chris Burke, Kevin Fitzpatrick, and Mike \"Sputz\" Krott at DODGEBALL 50.\n- ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ -\nTHE CAPTAINS\n>>> It's evolution! It's just amazing how dodgeball has evolved from a small 12-person gathering last Labor Day to a one-year plus journey. The process never ceases as ideas originally planned for only one night return at an event equal in significance ... a team Rimshot Contest at DODGEBALL LX!\nFor the first time at DODGEBALL 50, a special pre-game elimination-style rimshot competition debuted to decide who would be the very men [or women] vying for the main event spots. That night, by sheer coincidence, all four Adams brothers made history together as Steve and Kevin defeated Tom and Chris.\nTen events later, the same contest returned to determine which two teams would square-off in a huge 2-person team battle at the 60th dodgeball event. Those that entered knew what was at stake; Mark Entwistle & John Tronolone, Lenny Herrera & Kevin Adams, Valerie Winston & Lauren Winston, Stephan Whitacre & Mike Schuman, Dan Spengeman & Sara DeCuir, Kerrin Marchese & Mike Edwards, and Kathryn Nogueira & Aimee Savoth.\nMark Entwistle on his first try (and the first person in the contest) smacked the rim as he along with teammate John Tronolone immediately advanced. Half of the equation was there and all that was needed was a second alliance. And thanks to Dan Spengeman, he and partner in crime Sara DeCuir would secure that second spot at DODGEBALL LX.\nTHE MATCH\n-- Mark Entwistle & John Tronolone vs. Dan Spengeman & Sara DeCuir --\nA see-saw match-up for the World Heavyweight Championship!\nDODGEBALL LX had all the excitement and action one could handle; a true classic by night's end. Mike Edwards, Kevin Adams, new female sensation Kerrin Marchese, among others kept the competition at an all-time high. In the end, the somewhat unlikely duo of Mark and John defeated the legendary combination of Sara and Dan.\nMark Entwistle and John Tronolone [narrowly] defeated Dan Spengeman and Sara DeCuir at the 60th dodgeball extravanganza, 6 - 5.\n- ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ -\nTHE MEMORIES\n>>> Those that have attended the previous ten-events will surely never forget the great moments each and every one of the season-ending events has provided. DODGEBALL LX was no different and only furthered the very phrase some already believed to be true ... \"Believe the Hype\".\nA compilation if you will of several incredible moments from DODGEBALL LX:\n- The set-up of about eight garbage cans, eight tables cloths, and two \"LX\" streamer designs.\n- The music treatment with popular bands Soundgarden, Van Halen, Pearl Jam, and Metallica, to singles artists like Will Smith and even Peter Gabriel.\n- Derek Carty and Rob Avakian taking vicious faceshots thanks to John Tronolone.\n- Mike Edwards in one game eliminating his entire opposing team.\n- Alison Bertsch dodging a bullet from Jim Butler; behind Alison was Diana DiBuccio who got nailed instead.\n- Kerrin Marchese's all-around athletic talents, proving that women are as dominant as the out-numbering men.\n- John Tronolone taking two shots in his neck/throat and left nipple, courtesy of Rob Avakian.\n- Perhaps the greatest feud in dodgeball today: Matt Brown vs. Kevin Fitzpatrick.\n- Lenny Herrera's catching streak in the latter part of the evening.\n- The emergence of the \"Drive-By\" Manasquan high school students.\n- ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ -\nTHE RECORDS\n> Attendance: 30\n> Biggest Return: Mark Entwistle (Last played at DODGEBALL 41)\n> New Players: (7) Jesse Paxton, Brian Rorman, Jeff Semienski, Jack Gramlich, Michael Schuman, Stephan Whitacre, Kerrin Marchese.\n> Theme song: Soundgarden\n\"Superunknown\"\n> DODGEBALL LX was the first ten-event to include the \"Letsche Rims\", also known as the wooden rims.\n> DODGEBALL LX hosted the first rimshot contest to involve two winning teams. It was also the second [recorded] team battle following DODGEBALL 50 on August 4th.\n> Captains Information:\n- Mark Entwistle made his first captains appearance ever. He is 1-0-0.\n- John Tronolone broke two records at DODGEBALL LX: (A) Third time as captain at a ten-event following his matches at 20 and 30; (B) Seventh time overall as captain, beating the previous record of six held by both Steve and Kevin Adams. It was John's second consecutive event as captain as well having beaten Chris Adams last week at LIX. His record has improved to 3-4-0.\n- Dan Spengeman suffered his first loss as captain. His record is 2-1-0.\n- Sara DeCuir is the female with the most number of captain's runs. She is now 2-4-0.\n> The new award categories were the \"L.A. Dodger\" Award and the \"Ultimate Appreciation\" Award.\n> Alexandra Ratcliffe became the youngest recipient of an award at age 5.\n> In a shocking occurance, Kevin Megill missed his first event since DODGEBALL TWENTY-SIX back in mid-February.\n> Another interesting note concerns the following people: Chris Adams, Mike \"Sputz\", Ryan McCrorey, John Watters, Steve Adams. All of them missed their first ten-event.\n- ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ -\nTHE CONTRIBUTORS\nAs always, a special \"thank you\" is sent out to the contributors of such events. Lenny Herrera, Kevin Adams, Aimee Savoth, Kathryn Nogueira, and John Tronolone helped decorate for the occasion. Though the event started at 6pm, they were there by 5.\nEven further \"thanks\" to Kathryn Nogueira for the use her iPod throughout the entire event.\nAnd again, for the third time, \"thank you\" Kathryn Nogueira (with much assistance from her sister Elizabeth) for printing out the Dodgeball Excellence Awards.\nThough he didn't attend, Ryan Letsche is also thanked as the wooden rims he made have added a little extra excitement to dodgeball.\n--> As always, \"\nthank you\n\" to\neveryone\nwho came, saw, and experienced the event of a lifetime. I, the writer of dodgeball, and on behalf of John Tronolone, hope you enjoyed DODGEBALL LX from beginning to end!\n- ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ -\n\"The SuperBowl of Dodgeball\"",
