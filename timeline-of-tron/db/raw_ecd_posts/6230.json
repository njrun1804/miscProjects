The competition is always exceptional, and XONE and XTWO provided that for all. The second season of dodgeball has seemingly started for all players, new and old ...\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nPart I of the \"Double Header\"\n>>> DODGEBALL XONE <<<\nThe second dodgeball event to take place on a Friday turned out to be amazing. Right from the start, XONE was making history, as it set a new attendance record for the first time since D-DAY VI back on October 1st. Thirty-three (33) fired-up challengers stepped onto the dodgeball court and made history. Out of those thirty-three, four new players joined the fray, which is always a plus. Let the games begin! ...\nThe \u201cEra of Devolution\u201d seemed to have been more than just a prediction. Hall of Famer Mike Rozz and the ever-intense Kyle Carty were captains for the night, making for a unique match-up.\nThe teams were split rather interestingly, as Mike Rozz acquired many top veterans, four of which Hall of Famers themselves. Kyle on the other hand chose many of the younger and newer players, with \u201cQS\u201d Dan being his only HOF choice. Kyle had also picked only a few experienced veterans as well, which most thought would be his biggest mistake ...\nRight from the start, Mike and his team of veterans underestimated their opposition, which was a crucial error. Chris Adams, Justin Pierce, Mike Rozz, and even the \u201cCreation\u201d KJohn all voiced their opinions on how the games would easily be won by this \u201cDream Team\u201d of veterans. It was safe to say that the most powerful throwers were on Mike\u2019s team, making for good reason to be \u201cconfident\u201d. But by the end of the first game, Kyle and his squad of up-and-coming competitors completely shut the mouths of the veterans. The \u201cDream Team\u201d would enter into a nightmare, as the first game was only a prelude for what was about to come ...\nThat picture easily shows the determination on the faces of Kyle (far right) and his fearless team. The veterans had truly underestimated their younger competition, and in turn, were utterly humiliated for what seemed to be the longest two hours in dodgeball history. Mike Rozz and his defenseless team were down three games to zero by 9pm, leaving just one hour for a possible comeback. But it was in that one hour where the balance of power shifted. No amount of embarrassment would stop the experienced veterans, as within this crucial time period, they made a complete turn around, tying this historical series at three apiece. With just minutes left in the night, the score of three to three would stay, as XONE would come to a close. XONE could have been the beginning of the \u201cEra of Devolution\u201d. Players who were once looked past are now in the spotlight, and deservingly so ...\nNewcomer Sara DeCuir sent shockwaves around the dodgeball scene. She is already being ranked right up there with the two female Hall of Famers, as she brought a level of intensity few have shown or seen. Her catching was very good, as was her dodging. Consistency should be her new best friend, seeing how it could most definitely earn her a spot in the HOF along with Lauren Freda and Diana DiBuccio.\nDerek Carty is arguably the best pure athlete in the entire dodgeball league. No one seems to jump as high as he does, which he uses to catch a mid air ball aimed at the rim or simply dodge any ball.\nJohn Watters is also another outstanding prodigy whose throwing capability should not go unnoticed. He too can jump with ease, snatching a ball headed for the rim.\nAlthough he played for about thirty minutes, Nick Peros showed what dodgeball is all about. The intensity level of this young challenger could very well be compared to the likes of both Ryan McCrorey and Steve Adams. Nick also caught just about every ball thrown at him as well, making him a standout player for the night.\nLast and certainly not least is Liz Nogueira. Liz stepped up her game tremendously, with important catches during the night. Her first catch of the night came at the hands of one Justin Pierce. When you catch a ball thrown by \u201cThe Piercer\u201d, you make history. Liz would go on to catch other balls thrown her way, especially one game winner... KJohn rifled a ball at his younger opposing team, only to have it deflected. Liz caught the deflection and won the game for her team.\nDODGEBALL XONE was an outstanding event. The biggest group of competitors formed to make dodgeball history, a feat that will be very hard to top ...\nWait, hold that thought ...\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nPart II of the \"Double Header\"\n>>> DODGEBALL XTWO <<<\nJust when you thought the group couldn\u2019t get any bigger, it did. Thirty-three fierce fighters joined for the memorable DODGEBALL XONE. But XTWO shattered that record with an astounding forty-two (42) players! Included in the large group of forty-two were six new players, bringing the total number of dodgeball participants to seventy-three (73). That is something no one could have predicted.\nA new way of forming teams came about at XTWO. The sign-in sheet gave us numbers for players, which would help divide the teams evenly ...\n> EVENS vs. ODDS\nThe competition was extremely quick as four wins were won by the ODDS within the first hour of play. This caused a little controversy though as the teams did indeed seem a little unmatched. A new idea was then proposed ...\n> 1-20 vs. 21-40*\nSince there was such a large number of players, anyone who signed in as numbers 1-20 would be on the same team. As for numbers 21-40, they would form the opposing side. This was a much better match-up, seeing how the wins went literally back and forth for the two hours that remained in the night. The score like the night prior ended the exact same; three to three. The conclusion of the night came with pictures of both teams, and then one huge picture of everyone involved with DODGEBALL XTWO.\n*Only a few players were switched around, as well as the last two that made up the forty-two in attendance*\n*Not all players are pictured*\nIn the eyes of many, Tom Adams was the standout player for XTWO. Admitting to have not played at his best at XONE, one cannot deny that he played awesome at XTWO. He could have very well put on the best catching display of anyone in history, catching just about every ball thrown to him. He was catching so much to a point where his opponents were actually shouting at him to \u201cStop catching\u201d. You add in his throwing ability, and you have undoubtedly one of the best in the game.\nHonorable mentions in terms of catching go to Lenny Herera and Darien Brown, both who made catching look quite easy.\nZach Katz made his debut at XTWO and within a good few minutes, became a very feared competitor. His strength could mirror that of the two \u201cPowerhouse Thrower\u201d Award winners Mike Rozz and Chris Adams.\nRyan McCrorey ups his game every week it seems. He is using his intensity to his advantage these days which seems to suck an opponent into his many \"traps\" if you will. Between catching and throwing, Ryan is a top player.\nIn one of the more \"frightening\" moments, the largest athlete in dodgeball, Mike Rozz, was nailed right in the face with one of the smaller bullet balls. As soon as that happened, many players became very quiet quick. During the hush silence, KJohn is yelling, wanting to know who committed such an act. Newcomer and [apparently] solid thrower Kevin Fitzpatrick stepped up, admitting to have done the damage. After the game had ended, Kevin being a mans man (or perhaps fearing for his life), apologized to Mike. Mike was not angry by any means, realizing that this great sport is for fun and accidents can and will happen at any time.\nLauren Freda and Valerie Winston were once again at each other\u2019s throats as this feud that started at DODGEBALL VII continued into XTWO. Both women eliminated each other several times. That obviously will not settle anything between the two as we move on to another week.\nAs a final note, DODGEBALL XTWO ended in a most interesting way. KJohn, with a strong squad in tact, made the final three kills of the night. The first two came as a double kill, in which Ben was hit hard in the back with a \u201cpain\u201d ball. That very ball ricocheted right into newcomer Chris B\u2019s leg, eliminating him as well. Chris Adams was the final member of his team, and his lifesaver was indeed the \u201crim\u201d rule. The Hall of Famer could have easily hit the rim if it wasn\u2019t for one thing; a \u201cnut\u201d shot courtesy of his rival KJohn. KJohn is seemingly the man to have made the \u201cnut\u201d shot famous. Dan Karen, Tom Adams, Kyle Carty, and now Chris Adams can all tell you what it is like to be hit as hard as possible in the groin, courtesy \u201cThe Creation\u201d.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nDODGEBALL XONE and DODGEBALL XTWO were two of the best events around. Both were different in many ways, but provided the same fun and excitement that dodgeball brings every week. The numbers truly speak for themselves as the popularity of dodgeball increases with each passing week. Most would have thought that thirty-three was a lot. That of course changed when an over-whelming forty-two attended XTWO.\nPictures from both events, as well as DODGEBALL X, can all be found here:\nhttp://community.webshots.com/user/undertaker15yrs\nDODGEBALL 13 is next and will take place on November 12th.
