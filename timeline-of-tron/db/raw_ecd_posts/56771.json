Unexpected to them, they were unanimously chosen as the event's rival captains, instantly cementing their names into the dodgeball records forever. In the grueling three-hour encounter, Ray picked up the win by a mere two points, a certain prelude of things to come.\nThe Third Member: DODGEBALL XXVIII (2.25.06)\nJust a few short weeks after the initial \"outbreak\" of Pond Scum came the third, and perhaps most controversial competitor of the group, Dan Turner. Like his Pond Scum counterparts, eyes and ears opened as Dan became one of the game's hottest commodities.\nThe Plan (Summer 2006)\nRay and Dan began formulating a certain \"invasion\" or \"attack\", sure to shake up the very foundations of the sport. With the complete reformation of Pond Scum as a formidable unit, it was only a matter of time before they made their presence felt, challenging the legends of\nEastCoastDodgeball\n.\nThe months of preparation and secrecy had come to a head as the sharp decline in attendances gave the go ahead for war immediately following DODGEBALL LX.\nThe Invasion: DODGEBALL LX3 (11.11.06)\n\"The dodgeball world has no idea what's coming ... We sure hope the vets and the new pups are ready for the most shocking event in dodgeball history ... that no one has any idea about!!!!!!\"\n(October 18, 2006 post entitled \"DODGEBALL 63\")\nThat was just one of many messages posted right here on\ndodgeball.livejournal.com\n. It was obvious that a premeditated attack on the sport was imminent, and that DODGEBALL LX3 was chosen as the stage to wage war. But questions arose following such comments as to who the perpetrator [or perpertrators] was. After weeks of turmoil and back-and-forth online bickering, the time had come for the revelation. At DODGEBALL LX3, four* bodies approached the hallowed tennis courts, revealing themselves to indeed be Pond Scum.\nThough Pond Scum failed to claim victory, they were fearless in their attempt to topple the mighty 14-person counterstrike. After the invasion was put to a hault, Pond Scum split, forming completely different armies and taking part in a rare four-team tournament. The latter half of the night witnessed Ray Marzarella go undefeated, taking down Dan Turner in the final round. Ray had proven his dominance yet again. Dan has anxiously and patiently awaited his chance at redemption ever since.\nWould Pond Scum have imploded if the\nInvasion of LX3\nbeen a success?\n*Dan arrived before his PS teammates in an effort to sway accusations.\nThe Undefeated Streak: DODGEBALL EIGHTY-THREE (4.14.07)\nIt's been twenty events since the invasion and who better to headline DODGEBALL EIGHTY-THREE than these two warriors.\nRay Marzarella's\nunblemished captains streak is on the line as former ally\nDan Turner\nlooks to put an end to the \"Marzarella Massacres\".
