  "body_text": "August 4, 2006 is a day that will forever be remembered by the many people involved.\nWith many surprises already in store, DODGEBALL 50 will surpass any previous event. Several \"firsts\" have been announced throughout the past two weeks including catering by\nA.S.K. FoodsInc.\nand a gigantic 2-on-2 captains battle featuring singles champion Kevin Adams. Perhaps the biggest role during the \"ten\" events is that good ole feeling of nostalgia. Everyone knows the deal; awards, music, etc. That list just goes on and on.\nHopefully not to jinx the event itself, but the attendance is looking good. It is obviously unknown what the exact number will be until gametime, but in all hopes, may the turnout rise above 40. Past predications have usually been right on. But even the events of past cannot compare to the timeless event that DODGEBALL 50 will soon become.\nAnother small point of interest concerns newblood. Will the dodgeball world witness the emergence of new players at the biggest spectacle in dodgeball history? Let's just hope so.\n.............\nIt was often wondered if dodgeball would have even made it as far as it has. Through the worries of crappy foam footballs and the torturous weather of the winter months, to the unplanned \"invasions\" of high school students and the battles within, dodgeball has changed many lives through its 11 month run. It has been a rollercoaster ride to say the least filled with plenty of excitement, laughter, and memories.\nAnd so, I, John Tronolone, simply say \"Thank You\". All of us, together, have made this what it is today.\nWelcome to DODGEBALL 50 ... and welcome home.",
