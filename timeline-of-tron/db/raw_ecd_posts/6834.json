You have your Mike Rozz's, your Chris Adams's, among other outstanding players [and Hall of Famers]. But as time progresses, it is easy to notice that with time comes change. \"A New Generation\" if you will is slowly taking over, or at least reaching the heights of some of the bigger guns, much to the surprise and even chagrin of many long-term, established players. DODGEBALL 13 is a perfect example of how the \"Era of Devolution\" could be a reality ...\n\"The Battle of the Dans\" headlined DODGEBALL 13 making it a most unique match-up:\nDan Karen vs. Dan Spengeman.\nBoth men picked very wisely, as each match was extremely close. The action was non-stop, as balls were launched from both sides at every second. With the score tied at 3, the deciding game went quickly, as \"Quick Sand\" and his team were just a little hungrier for the final victory. They earned that last game, defeating their ruthless opposition in one of the more impressive and easily competitive dodgeball wars. In order for an event to be full of ruthlessness, aggression, and competition, one cannot forget an important factor ...\n... It always goes without saying that certain players make a impact on the game, and on this night, many players deserve those props ...\nHe made his debut at DODGEBALL DAY 2 over two months ago and has easily brought a level of excitement and passion like no other. Steve Adams, arguably the most charismatic competitor to ever grace the dodgeball court, did a fine job at 13. Steve caught just about every ball thrown to him, tremendously helping out his team in the process. His level of intensity needs not be mentioned, as it is always high. But his catching on this night proved to be top notch. Well done by this popular veteran.\nAlso worthy of being noted is one Valerie Winston. She had some crucial eliminations, including a gigantic one on the near invincible Chris Adams.\nSpeaking of Chris Adams, for the second week in a row, he and Mike Rozz went at it. A battle of the \"Powerhouse Throwers\" was a definite highlight of the night, as the action almost stopped when both men approached the line. This could easily become of one the \"biggest\" feuds (no pun intended) of all time.\nKevin Fitzpatrick, known to many as \"Fitz\", is becoming one of the more distinguished players since his debut at DODGEBALL XTWO. Kevin couldn't have made a bigger impact than when he propelled a \"Bullet\" ball right into Mike Rozz's jaw just last week. At 13, he got several eliminations, including two on KJohn. A job well done by this hungry, aggressive rookie.\nWhen you think of outstanding players, a few names come to mind. The six Hall of Famers are by far the most recognized, and rightfully so. However, new names are quickly progressing into the mainstream of elite players. Evolution is having its effect on the game ...\n... Sara DeCuir made an immediate impact on the sport, debuting at DODGEBALL XONE. She returned at DODGEBALL 13 and continued to show-off her athleticism throughout the night. When you are being compared to that of Lauren Freda and Diana DiBuccio on your second night, what more is there to say.\n... As for the men, no one has evidently made an impression than that of Tom Adams. The third eldest Adams brother is talked about in many dodgeball conversations, and for good reason; he's just that damn good. He has all the necesary tools to becoming one of the greatest of all time.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nI.\nAs announced at DODGEBALL 13, \"The Piercer\" Justin Pierce has completed the DODGEBALL XIV promotional poster. The poster will be released in the proper fashion at the start of the coming week.\nII.\nThe player profiles have been talked about for a while now, and soon, those too will finally be revealed to all.
