Hell yeah it did.\nDODGEBALL XXVIII will long be remembered as one of the greatest events in history. All events leave their mark on the sport, but some just happen to standout more than others. XXVIII is one of those few, elite events.\nThe Books:\n> Attendance: 32. (Sixth highest behind XTWO, 15, 20, 13, XONE)\n> Biggest Return:\nLauren Stopa (last played at DODGEBALL XTWO)\n> New players: Dan Turner, Guy Ritt, Chi So, Sammy Smith, Chris Wildeman, and Todd Binger.\n> Justin Pierce broke his string of events at DODGEBALL XXVIII. Since DODGEBALL DAY 2, he hadn't missed an event.\n> A Brother vs. Brother feud headlined XXVIII. For Steve Adams, his previous runs as captain came at DODGEBALL X and DODGEBALL TWENTY-SIX.

The reason being when compared to The Undertaker of the WWE, the similarities are endless. Both have held \"main-event status\" since their beginnings. Both are highly respected and are viewed by their peers as true leaders of their respective sports. DODGEBALL XXVIII continued the legend of Chris Adams with an incredible performance. Pin-point accuracy easily made him one of the top throwers. In one game, working by himself, he eliminated a good six players before going down. His dodging allowed him to stay in games for extended periods of time. There wouldn't be a Hall of Fame without Chris Adams.\nZach Katz was a force at XXVIII. Hard throws, catches and dodges, and longevity in many of the games made him an overall top player for the evening. Since his debut at DODGEBALL XTWO, he has been a target among many.\nFew people make an immediate impact the night of their debut. Names like Sara DeCuir (XONE), Matt Brown (15), and Tom Adams (8) certainly fit the bill. At DODGEBALL XXVIII, one man in particular took everyone to the extreme. Guy Ritt arguably has the most powerful and perhaps frightening throw ever. The question of \"Do you play baseball\" seemed to never leave anyones' mind. That very talent gained him a level of respect, and certainly fear on the dodgeball court.\nThe young prodigy John \"H2O\" Watters was a definite key player. Like Chris and Guy, his deadly weapon is his arm. He outlasted many opponents and teammates in several games as well. Without question, one of the best ever.\nAdmitting to being nervous before the action began, Sammy Smith played like a true pro. She had her share of eliminations, mainly by throwing.\nThe last piece of business concerns two of the very best in the game today. The \"injured list\" added both Kevin Fitzpatrick and Matt Brown this past week. Kevin endured a shoulder surgery while Matt recently broke his elbow. Both are out of action indefinitely but are certainly wished a speedy recovery.\n~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~\nDODGEBALL 29 is right around the corner. The \"action\" begins later this week with the \"Ultimate Poster Contest\" between Justin Pierce and Dan Spengeman.\nTo add to the hype, the winner of the contest will not be posted here on the dodgeball website.
