Keeping his two-point lead was all that Derek needed to secure his name into the record books and forever claim to be the man who defeated Joe Kelly. However, the well-documented match between the two ended differently with Joe's streak still in tact.\nAt DODGEBALL 42, Joe's next challanger was Prodigy Award winner Lenny Herrera, a man who has never once missed an event since his debut. There was only one question that remained: Could Lenny do it?\nFor the Fifth Time?: Lenny Herrera vs. Joe Kelly!\n\"The King of Captains\" Joe Kelly: the man who has undeniably dominated the dodgeball scene with four straight captains wins would be going for number \"5\" at DODGEBALL 42. It was match all eyes watched closely, with the outcome a must see.\nAs the match began, it looked as if Kelly had the better all-around squad. As time passed, the match appeared much more even, with wins earned left and right for both Joe and Lenny. About the time it was tied at 3 apiece, perhaps the most crucial component would be thrown into the mix; Captains Dodgeball.\nThe very game-type that gave Joe his first win some five events ago did a complete 360 at DODGEBALL 42. Having defeated Sara DeCuir in Captains Dodgeball at DODGEBALL 38, 42 was a completely different story as Joe did not earn a single win in the final games. By the end of the event, the score read 6 to 3 in favor of the newly crowned Champion, Lenny Herrera. There is no question that Captains Dodgeball spelled doom for \"The King of Captains\".\nWith all due respect, Joe Kelly was a fighting champion and certainly tough as nails, battling through an injured ankle last week as well as the biggest obstacle, his opponents for each of the events. Much credit is deserved to Joe as his unprecedented 4 and 0 streak seemingly changed the course of history. There is certainly new meaning to the word \"Captain\".\nAlready a Record Breaking Event\n> Attendance: 32\n> New Players: 0\nDespite a very solid turnout, DODGEBALL 42 marked only the fourth time there wasn't one new player. The previous times were at XXIV, TWENTY-SIX, and XXX-ONE.\n> Biggest Returns:\nAlysha Kelly (Last Played at DODGEBALL 15)\nDan Karen (Last Played at DODGEBALL 23)\n> Joe Kelly broke the record for \"Most Times Captain\" with five. He went in undefeated, but came out with his first loss. His record stands at an impressive 4 and 1. As for Lenny, it was his second time as captain having faced Matt Brown at DODGEBALL XXIV in a battle of \"Prodigy Captains\". The results of that event are still a mystery as it was unknown that night who won the captains battle. Lenny's record as of the comclusion of 42 will officially say 1 win.\n> DODGEBALL 42 was the first Ocean Road Park event since DODGEBALL 38 on April 28th. Next week, 43, follows with another ORP event.\n> Captains Dodgeball was played for the second time, following DODGEBALL 38.\n> In a rare occurance, Steve Adams did not attend DODGEBALL 42.\n> Equally as rare concerns the equipment. Not a single dodge ball was lost at DODGEBALL 42. Almost all ORP events have seen at least one or two balls lost.\nDodgeball Soldiers\nJohn Watters was an important factor in the outcome of the match. With numerous eliminations by both catching and throwing, the 16-year-old Powerhouse Thrower award winner is always a top dog on the court. Had John not stayed in each of the games as long as he did, perhaps the outcome of DODGEBALL 42 may have been different.\nOne of the newer female players was also a key ingredient with two crucial rimshots. Having claimed to never being able to hit it, Melissa Kerr perhaps even shocked herself with the first rimshot of DODGEBALL 42. She would hit another one much to her credit.\nIf only Kurt Gassner would become a full-time player, than the dodgeball world could be changed forever. Every time he steps onto the court, the level of intensity he brings goes unmatched. With a powerful arm and quick feet used for what look to be impossible dodges, Kurt easily ranks among the best.\nNo one could ever forget the legend of Justin Pierce. The charismatic and certainly loud player always turns it up a notch, always adding fun to each event. He has been a threatening player since the beginning days of dodgeball and will forever go down as one of the recognized players in history.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nA New Era Begins\nWhen one hunts and kills, they immediately become the hunted. Lenny Herrera's win at DODGEBALL 42 may have been the most significant victory ever, as it ended what looked to be an unstoppable captain in Joe Kelly.
