Kerrin Marchese, Lauren \"Cher\" Stopa, Melissa Kerr, and Diana DiBuccio, along side an array of recent new stars and old lions combined to make DODGEBALL LXI as memorable as they come.\nDiana DIBUCCIO vs. Kerrin MARCHESE\nIt's Old School 2005 vs. New Generation 2006.\nDiana DiBuccio has nothing else to prove in the game of dodgeball. She's eliminated everyone; the old, the large, the intense, and so on. But in the last two weeks, the women's division has heated up with the debut of sensation Kerrin Marchese. Put these two stars against one another and you have yourself a clash of the titans.\nThe Games\nGame 1: Diana\nGame 2: Kerrin\nGame 3: Diana\nGame 4: Diana\nGame 5: Diana\nGame 6: Kerrin\nGame 7: Kerrin\nGame 8: Kerrin\nGame 9: Kerrin\nGame 10: Diana\nIf you do the math, the score is exactly tied at 5! Obviously, there will be a rematch down the road to determine who is the better captain between the two. It's a war without conclusion!\nDiana DiBuccio and Kerrin Marchese fought to a tie at DODGEBALL LXI: 5 - 5.\nDiana's Allies\n-- Chris Adams showed endurance, aim, power, and catching throughout DODGEBALL LXI.\n-- Zach Katz has proven time and again he is among the elite. Few can block as well as he can.\nKerrin's Allies:\n-- A true pro is Kevin Adams, catching with ease. Another all-around performance.\n-- Kevin Fitzpatrick is a force to be reckoned with. His arm is as powerful as they come, especially with the face/ear shot on one John Tronolone.\nThe RECORDS\n- Attendance: 14\n- Biggest Return: Melissa Kerr (Last played at the One Year Anniversary, DODGEBALL 54)\n- DODGEBALL LXI was played on Rob Avakian's 20th birthday as well as the one year anniversary of DODGEBALL X.\n- DODGEBALL LXI will go down as arguably the windiest event ever.\n- Ten games were played in all despite the action stopping at about 9:45pm.\n- This is Diana DiBuccio's second tie as a captain. She tied Alison Bertsch at DODGEBALL TWENTY-TWO (oddly enough, another extremely windy event). Her record is 1-2-2.\n- Kerrin Marchese made a strong showing at her first attempt as captain. 0-0-1 is her record.\n- The \"Letsche Rims\" were used for the third-straight event.\n- Justin Pierce and Lauren Stopa played in their Halloween costumes ... Sonny Bono and Cher.\n- Ryan McCrorey also stopped by before the start of LXI. He too was dressed in costume; White Goodman from the Dodgeball movie two years ago.\n--->>The\nRevival Tour\nis off to a shaky start, but it will not faulter. DODGEBALL 62 is next.",
