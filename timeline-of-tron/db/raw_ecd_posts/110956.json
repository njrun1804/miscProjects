If the chosen captain was eliminated in any fashion, his or her entire team lost that round regardless of the number of in-play participants. The Writer paired the opposing captains prior to the match: Fitzpatrick-Edwards, Pierce-Adams, Winston-Winston.\nGame 3 witnessed Michael Edwards single-handedly eliminate rival Kevin Fitzpatrick from competition. Edwards was on the verge of a multi-player attack before wisely rifling a weapon of his own to capture the monumental game victory.\nIn Game 6, Chris Adams was the sole survivor for his team before carefully regenerating a fraction of his squad to his aid. The extra time allowed him to carefully connect with a bulletball shot to rival Justin Pierce's foot, who had remained in a defense state throughout the round.\nThe Winston sisters were heavily guarded during the 8th game as massive amounts of amo were unleashed upon the set of siblings. The round came to a close when Valerie Winston unintentionally dodged into a Michael Edwards-thrown bulletball. With this victory, the Adams-L. Winston-Edwards coalition captured all three of these special contests.\nIt should be noted that the stipulation was originally set for every third game, but due to time restraints, round 9 was moved up one.\n\u25ba Game-By-Game: Pierce-V. Winston-Fitzpatrick took home rounds 1, 5, 7, 9, and 10; Adams-L. Winston-Edwards won games 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. The deciding 11th game was in progress when the tennis lights powered off. Thus, the score remained at a deadlocked 5 apiece.\nINJURIES\nA total of 8 headshots were reported during STAR WARS. In the opening contest, Justin Wolf was met with a speeding bulletball from Chris Adams directly to the left eye. Ashley Hoppe received three stinging shots herself, one of which shed a trivial amount of blood to her nose. Steve Adams, Jason Teitelbaum, and captains Edwards and Pierce were also perpetrated in similar fashion.\nIn an update from the previous month's SUMMER JAMBOREE, John Tronolone announced that his glenoid labrum, a fibrocartilaginous rim attached around the shoulder blade, is partially torn. An MRI and visit to an orthopedic surgeon confirmed such in late-July. Under doctors' orders, he was recommended to cease full-force throwing with his right arm.\nAFTERMATH\nBecause of the shocking, inconclusive decision, The Writer has already announced that a rematch, particularly between the Winston sisters, will take place \"in the near future.\" As of August 16, 2011, no word has been given on if and when the male co-captains will meet again.\nThe heated Katz-Wolf confrontation continued throughout STAR WARS and will culminate in a captains duel at ANNIVERSARY 6 on September 10, 2011.\nSTATISTICS\nThe special stipulation was the first to be officially used at an\nECD\nevent. Previous outings had included such, but were never instituted upon the actual captains.\nAs of August 16, 2011, captaincy statistics are as follows:\n\u25ba Chris Adams is 7-7-1. This was his second three-on-three captains encounter following DODGEBALL CXV in December 2007.\n\u25ba Michael Edwards is 5-2-2. Along with Fitzpatrick, this was his record-sharing third three-on-three captains encounter following DODGEBALL 100 and DIVORCE COURT.\n\u25ba Kevin Fitzpatrick is 7-3-1. Along with Edwards, this was his record-sharing third three-on-three captains encounter following DODGEBALL 100 and DODGEBALL CXV.\n\u25ba Justin Pierce is 3-1-1. This was his second three-on-three captains encounter following DODGEBALL 100 in August 2007, and his first match in the captains chair since that very same event.\n\u25ba Lauren Winston is 4-5-3. This was her first three-vs-three captains encounter as well as her record-shattering 6th contest against her sister, Valerie.\n\u25ba Valerie Winston is 3-5-3. This was her first three-vs-three captains encounter as well as her record-shattering 6th contest against her sister, Lauren.\nBecause of their participation, STAR WARS was recognized as the first event to feature\nECDElite\nHall of Famers both as allies and enemies\npost-induction\n.\nRECEPTION\nSTAR WARS received acclaimed reviews from various critics.\nKevin Fitzpatrick awarded the event 10 out of 10, stating that \"it was definitely the best event so far this year, hands down.\nEveryone\nplayed awesome.\" He also praised the fairness of the teams as a reason for the event's success. Opposing team general Michael Edwards also rated the event a perfect 10. \"All of the dodgeball veterans produced some incredible competition; it was almost inevitable the two sides would end in a tie.\"\nTop selection Zach Katz rated the event 8 out of 10, citing that \"balanced teams, fast-paced action, quick games, and some format changes to mix things up\" were all key ingredients. \"Aside from multiple headshots .. this event was non-stop fun.\" Diana DiBuccio agreed with Katz's ranking, explaining \"that an event like this shows that people are still able to step up and play hard.\" She also applauded the efforts of the captains.\nKelly Oberto, who granted the event an impressive 9/10, stated \"the\nonly\ndownside is the bruises left over from massive hits to my leg and ass.\"\nDespite spending a majority of STAR WARS in the crowd, Joanice Lima gave a flawless 5 out of 5 stars. \"The teams were really even.
