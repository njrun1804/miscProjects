Based primarily on many responses from the previous entry, DODGEBALL 36 will be played at Wall High School. If the courts are taken, then there is always Ocean Road Park. For now though, prepare for gameplay at Wall High School this coming Saturday.\nDue the late arrivals of many players, please be at WHS by 6:30. This way teams can form and the game can begin by 7.\nDODGEBALL 36\n6:30 Start Time\nWall High School",
