The 2007 \"Rivalry of the Year\" re-emerged for the first time since\nThanksgiving Weekend 2010\n.\nIt was the 191st event within the\nTronolone Era\nand just the 15th Friday outing compared to a whopping 170 Saturday and just six Sunday. The Wall High School rear tennis courts played host from 5:30pm to 10:00pm.\nThough only few drops were felt, CALL OF DUTY was also \"Wet War XXXVII\".\nMAIN ATTRACTION: WALL v. ALL 12\nThe predominant attraction of CALL OF DUTY was the pride-filled encounter pitting the hometown warriors WALL against the visiting invaders ALL. The division of individual soldiers was based strictly on the high school graduated, currently attended, or will attend.\nInitially, it looked as if ALL would march towards victory after the opening contest. Indeed the overwhelming stature possible reason for the immediate success. Eight grueling rounds later, ALL failed to claim another win regardless of classic two-team or Prison Ball rules in effect.\nWhy the collapse? WALL remained consistent in both strategy and army size, and certainly enough to force the early departures of some of their most battle-tested adversaries.\nWALL soundly defeated ALL, 8 - 1, at CALL OF DUTY. It was the largest margin of victory in the well-documented history of\nWALL v.
