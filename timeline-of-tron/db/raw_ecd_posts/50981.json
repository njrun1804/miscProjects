  "body_text": "\"The energy that is currently running through me is shaking the very foundations of my state of mind. I believe my comrades would feel the same emotions concerning this monumentous event. For the past few weeks, I have become attached to a peculiar group of friends. Some of whom I consider quite dear, considering I have only known them for such a short time. As this event comes evermore closer, I ponder the emotions one could feel in such a tournament. The sheer unknown grounds we tread upon will most likely shake our mettle. Despite this, I feel this team will overcome emotion and utilize their experience to overcome these obsticals. In conclusion, I would like to mention one last thing. I wish our competetors, the ORP Knights, all the best in this friendly competition. Good night and godspeed dodgeball warriors.\"\n- R.A.T.S. Member SASCHA BASISTA\n\"Tonight, as I sit here on the eve of Eastcoast Dodgeball's entrance into the spotlight, I have mixed emotions. On one hand, I think it will be so exciting to participate in an official, regulated game of dodgeball. Waging war against dozens of strangers with my excellent allies will be an unforgettable experience. On the other hand, I find myself struggling with fear. Sure, we've played 74 events already, but this tournament will be unlike any event we've ever had. The thought of a giant, unfamiliar venue filled with a giant, unfamiliar crowd is really making me nervous. I know, however, that I will be fine when game time comes. You see, these amazing allies of mine are more than just my allies- they're my friends, and, in all honesty, I can't think of nine people I'd rather stand united with.\"\n- O.R.P.
