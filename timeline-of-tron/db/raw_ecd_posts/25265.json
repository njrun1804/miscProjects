For sometime, specifically starting at DODGEBALL 33, it has been well known that the lights at Ocean Road Park are back on. The question is, should dodgeball return to its home for good?

As with any situation though, expect pros and cons.\nI.\nOcean Road Park should be played in the summertime. Wall High School hosted throughout part of Fall, all of Winter, and the start of Spring. ORP, the birthplace of dodgeball, should host the weekly events during the summertime and into Fall [like in 2005].\nCON: It is highly likely that the amount of dodge balls will diminish. When compared to ORP, only one ball has been lost at WHS. It appears at almost every event held at ORP, the loss of equipment is almost a  guarantee. Keep in mind, the courts could be full (the same can be said for WHS remember).\n---------------------------------\nII.\nPerhaps rotating venues on a weekly basis would be the best way to keep everyone happy. Example would be all even-numbered events are at ORP, while the odd-numbered are at WHS.\nCON: People who like playing at only one venue might only show up at that very venue. This could almost \"split\" the group itself. Don't expect high turnouts.\n---------------------------------\nIII. Rotate location by month. Example would be all May events at ORP, June at WHS, July at ORP, and so on.\nCON: Although probably not as severe, but the seperation of players due to popular location could factor in.\n---------------------------------\nIV.\nPlay at a third location.\nCON: A third location has not been found due to strict rules at many surrounding parks and courts.\n---------------------------------\nV.\nTeam ORP vs. Team WHS: A best of 3 series for the right of location. The first two matches will take place at each venue, with a [if necessary] final match held at a third location. If a third location is not found, the location of the final match can be decided by scores from the previous matches.\nCON: The level of competition could reach new heights, thus creating tension between players. Also, one team could have a significant higher amount of players. It would seemingly be better to vote instead.\n---------------------------------\nPlease voice your opinions with a comment, email, etc.\nIf no decisions are made within the next few days, then a location will randomly be picked for DODGEBALL 36.",
