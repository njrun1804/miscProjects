Foam footballs, the surprising inclusion of bulletballs, human rims, and even a broken finger will surely be remembered at the OYA.\nBut the past cannot be changed. The future however is different.\n??? vs. ???\nDODGEBALL FIFTY-FIVE is currently without rival captains. Now usually a rimshot contest would take place to make it easier for everyone, and obviously have additional fun. But at FIFTY-FIVE, the \"game before the game\" will not be witnessed.\nDODGEBALL XXX4, subtitled \"A Roll of the Dice\", pitted Dan Spengeman against Justin Pierce in a memorable encounter. That night, neither of them just decided to be captains, but rather their names were picked from a hat.\nAt DODGEBALL FIFTY-FIVE, two names will be drawn at random, pitting them in a one-on-one captains showdown. They will then form their own teams much like every other standard event. Much like the rimshot contests, everyone is eligible!\n>> DODGEBALL FIFTY-FIVE is Saturday, Sept. 9th at Wall High School ... 6:30pm.\nThe Poster\nThe DODGEBALL FIFTY-FIVE poster will be one of the last posters created by Dan Spengeman for some time. He is giving up his poster priveleges, which will return to the hands of the self-proclaimed \"King of the World\", John Tronolone. John has vowed to return tradition to such designs.\nFeatured Matches\nAlthough captains will chosen at random this coming weekend, that still does not mean people cannot name themselves captains for a future event. But say you wanted to face someone of your choosing, and they agreed to it?\nA perfect example would be the captains match already set for DODGEBALL 59: Chris Adams vs. John Tronolone II. The two men have already agreed to their return match as it was they who headlined DODGEBALL 9 some 50 events before.\nSo if you have a match in which you would like to see or participate in, let yourself be heard and an event will be saved for you [and your partner]. The only events in which people cannot name themselves captain would be the \"ten\"s.",
