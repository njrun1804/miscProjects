  "body_text": "What an event ... a poster contest, a raffle, and the action itself made for a complete night. The first event of March 2006 will long be remembered by all in attendance. Is this a \"family\" or what?\n----------------------------------------\n--------------------\nThe RECORD BOOKS:\n> Attendance: 30 (Other events with the same number: VI, 17, 21)\n> Biggest return: Justin Godynick (Last played at DODGEBALL 19)\n> New Players: (2) Katie Hansen and Anthony Freda.\n> A record breaking night for Travis Mills as he was captain for the first time in his career. It was only the second time for Zach Katz as he went one-on-one with Kevin \"Fitz\" at DODGEBALL 19.\n> For the first time since DODGEBALL 20, still pictures were captured. They can be found at\nhttp://community.webshots.com/user/undertaker15yrs\n.\n> Results of the \"Ultimate Poster Contest\" were revealed to the world: Justin Pierce defeated Dan Spengeman.\n#4 ... 48% (Created by Justin Pierce) [shown above]\n#1 ... 22% (Created by Justin Pierce)\n#3 ... 19% (Created by Dan Spengeman)\n#2 ... 11% (Created by Dan Spengeman)\nFollowing the results, the winner of a special raffle was awarded a picture with one Justin Pierce. The winner of the raffle was fierce thrower Alison Bertsch.\n----------------------------------------\n--------------------\nThe SPOTLIGHT:\nThe light shined on one Rob Avakian, known to many as \"Sharp\". Trench coat and all, Rob was a threat in each game with his many great catches. He debuted at DODGEBALL 8 back in October and to say he hasn't brought something to dodgeball would be an understatement.\nIn recent events, deflections have become a major part of dodgeball. DODGEBALL 29 had its share of ball-blockers: Travis Mills, Joe Kelly, and Kevin Megill.\nKurt Gassner, the only player to debut at the unforgettable DODGEBALL X, brought his \"A\" game. His many dodges prevented him from the dreaded elimination line many a time.\nKevin \"Fitz\" sucked up the pain of his surgically-repaired shoulder and played dodgeball like a true champion. Easily one of the most recognized and feared players on the court, he delivered big despite feeling less than 100%.\nAlison Bertsch, also with an injured limb, gave it her all at DODGEBALL 29. For weeks, a foot injury has left her soar before, during, and after each event. However, she plays her hardest every time she steps onto the court.\nIn perhaps one of the most unpredictable and to some, controversial happenings in recent memory, two men earned a victory the hard way. Facing what looked to be impossible odds, both Tom Adams and John Tronolone were the remaining two on their team. Most would think why not just go for \"rim\"? As \"luck\" would have it, \"rim\" had already been hit. This left Tom and John had a huge disadvantage as they faced some of the hottest competitors. Names like the methodical Mike \"Sputz\", the sniper-rifle Chris Adams, \"hot hands\" catcher Rob Avakian, among others were ready to take the two-man team apart. But one by one, Adams and Tronolone slowly picked off their aggressive opponents. It took a good five to ten minutes, but the game ended with Tom and John wiping out every last opponent; a good ten men. But controversy surrounds these circumstances ... Some believe Tom was hit during this showdown. Tom denied all allegations, and the mayhem continued with him still in the game. Was he hit? Who really knows. The truth remains with the third eldest Adams brother.\nDodgeball would not be the same without Derek Carty. Truly a gifted athlete and very dedicated player, Derek's overall performance at 29 continued his already legendary career. He jumped amazingly high, dodging numerous throws each game. His arm, certainly not to be looked past, is as dangerous as they come. Derek has established himself as one of the true greats of the sport.\n----------------------------------------\n--------------------\nThe MAIN EVENT: Mills vs. Katz\nIn a match that will be remembered as a true classic, Captain Zach Katz pulled out the huge victory over long-time veteran and rival captain Travis Mills with a final score of 6 to 3. The success of Zach's team could be attributed to players already mentioned like Derek, Tom, among others. Taking nothing away from Zach, he too contributed his share of eliminations and key plays.\n----------------------------------------\n--------------------\nGet ready for awards, music, excitement, and the big return \"home\" ... Are you ready for DODGEBALL 30?",
