  "body_text": "The Engagement Ring, The Wedding Ring, The\nSuffering\nEVENT BACKGROUND\nFATAL ATTRACTION\nwas the 189th\nEast Coast Dodgeball\nspectacular produced within the second\nTronolone Era\n.\nIt was originally scheduled for May 5 but was quickly moved to May 12 due to the main event captains' conflicting schedules.\nThe pre-planned bout featured future bride and groom Joanice Lima against Christopher Adams one week before their anticipated wedding, a match that was accepted on March 9, 2012. It was the 11th\nCREAMation Rules\nbattle in\nECD\nhistory.\nMAIN ATTRACTION\nIn the night's main event, wily veteran and\nECDElitist\nChristopher Adams\nwent one-on-one against his gorgeous future wife and reigning\nHitTheHuman Contest\nChampion\nJoanice Lima\n.\nCREAMation Rules\n- where the losing captain suffers the public embarrassment of a whipped cream pie to the face - were in effect.\nIt was a grueling, nearly four hour, 12-rounder. The first six games were split equally among the contenders; the back six were owned by the Adams-lead coalition who managed to capture five to Lima's one. The final tally after the last weapon was thrown read \"Adams 8, Lima 4\".\nClassic two-team rules stood until Game 5 when Prison Ball carried the remainder of the event.\nSTATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE\nFATAL ATTRACTION attracted\ntwenty three\n(23) participants, two higher than the previous presentation, WORLD TOUR, in April. While no new competitors were present, several major returns are noted in Mari Travassos, Grant Cornero, Derek Carty, and Steve Kass.\nThe\nLima v. Adams confrontation helped boost spectatorship\nas well with appearances by Vicki Oliver, Katie Grand, DODGEBALL CX headliner Michael Butler, and yes, even the parents of both Lima and Adams. Additionally, Suki and Logan, the playful dogs of Jon Yochum/Mari Travassos and Jason Teiltelbaum, respectively, were amongst the sideline crowd.\nCAPTAINCY STATISTICS\nLima's record unfortunately slips to 0-2-0, having been vanquished by\nECDElite\nHall of Famer Lauren Stopa at\nMAYDAY\nin May 2011.\nAdams became just the third captain (along with Ryan Letsche and John Tronolone) to win two\nCREAMation Rules\ncontests, his first victory coming in September 2007\n(see below)\nagainst long-standing rival Kevin Fitzpatrick. Additionally, he becomes the\nonly\nplayer to captain a team in every full year within the\nTronolone Era\n, spanning from 2005-2008 and 2010-2012. His captains record moves to 8-7-1 having lead a team in the second-most number of matches 16 different times behind only Tronolone with 17.\n________________________________________\n_______________________________\nMore \"PIE In The EYE\" Moments\nCREAMation 1 | March 24, 2007\n\u2192 Kevin Adams & Valerie Winston defeated Lenny Herrera & John Tronolone.\nCREAMation 2 | June 9, 2007\n\u2192 Justin Pierce & Juan Londono defeated Diana DiBuccio.\nCREAMation 3 | September 29, 2007\n\u2192 Chris Adams defeated Kevin Fitzpatrick.\nCREAMation 4 | December 15, 2007\n\u2192 Ryan McCrorey defeated Sascha Basista.\nCREAMation 5 | February 9, 2008\n\u2192 Lauren Stopa & Ryan Letsche defeated Lauren Winston & Grant Cornero.\nCREAMation 6 | March 22, 2008\n\u2192 John Tronolone defeated Valerie Winston.\nCREAMation 7 | May 24, 2008\n\u2192 Ryan Letsche defeated Bobby Vetrano.\nCREAMation 8 | September 27, 2008\n\u2192 Alison Bertsch defeated Pamela D'Luhy.\nCREAMation 9 | November 22, 2008\n\u2192 John Tronolone defeated Ryan Letsche.\nCREAMation 10 | October 16, 2010\n\u2192 Ryan Rafferty, Ashley Hoppe, & Dan Spengeman defeated Julia Dennebaum, Michael Edwards, & Michelle Mullins.",
