  "body_text": "The final chapter ... the culmination of hard-work, dedication, and sacrifice coming together for one spectacular night. This finale event capped off one of the most unpredictable and exciting periods in dodgeball's nearly two year run.\nHours, weeks, and even months of preparation and hype came to a head as two of the baddest animals to ever compete locked horns at one of the most anticipated events of all-time. The court general\nJustin Pierce\n, the athletic all-star\nTom Adams\n, a brawl for all the marbles!\nThe most brutally hard-hitting, in-your-face five games ever, even from the sidelines! The stunning dodging performance of Mike Butler, painfully impactful body shots delivered by Chris Adams, John Tronolone, and Tom Adams, and will to win by those fighting through injury set the tone for the next three-hours. And don't forget, if battling on the \"east\", you were more than likely to lose!\nThat's right, a proverbial \"West Side Story\", meaning the \"west\" courts brought good fortune and a little luck in the bloodthirsty conflict known as DODGEBALL 90. Team ADAMS started the eventual pattern, taking the inaugural round of this heated contest. But Pierce would rebound fiercely with a hard-fought victory of his own. Games 3 and 4, same situation, same outcome - Adams takes one, Team PIERCE the next.\nWith the fifth and final game, the odds appeared heavily stacked against the loud-mouthed Pierce as neither team had been able to pull off the upset victory from the haunted and ill-fated \"east\". But with some game-saving plays by secret sideline specialist Valerie Winston and imposing powerhouse Kevin Megill, lemon turned to lemonade as \"The Piercer\" became the first competitor to defeat the mighty Tom Adams in singles action.\nDODGEBALL 90 ... Justin Pierce defeated Tom Adams, 3 - 2.\nSeason 9\n-- What a season ...\nCREAMation Rules\n, a double birthday celebration, the return of the\nRimshot Contest\n, just to name a few.\n-- Average attendance was 25.5 with a total of 27 new stars.\n-- A record-setting five\nWet Wars\n; the most ever in a single season.\n-- Travis Mills, Justin Godynick, Dan Karen, Derek Carty, Liz and Kathryn Nogueira, Wesley Hebrew, among others returning to the dance for the first time in ages.\n-- Kevin Megill, Diana DiBuccio, Kevin Adams, and John Tronolone attended all ten Season 9 events.\n-- Serious injuries: Kevin Adams's right pinky finger ligament tear from DODGEBALL 88; Mike \"Sputz\" Krott's right pinky finger fracture from DODGEBALL 89.\nDODGEBALL 90\n-- Decorations included streamer-\"flags\" as well as an awesome DODGEBALL 90 poster created by Mike \"Sputz\".\n-- A terrific music compliation by legend Chris Adams.\n-- The spectacular series of dodges by the intense Mike Butler.\n-- Sascha Basista unaware of the blood dripping from his left knee.\n-- Continuous, accidental assaults on unsuspecting eliminated participants.\n-- The vicious confrontations between Steve Adams and John Tronolone.\n-- Valerie Winston's game-saving kills on Kevin Fitzpatrick and Rob Avakian, capped with a catch thrown by Jodi Holt during Game 5.\n-- The match-winning kill on Mike Edwards by DODGEBALL 80 rival Kevin Megill.\n-- The earth-shattering announcement regarding DODGEBALL 100 ...\nThe Countdown to 100\n... In the first drawing to determine captains for DODGEBALL 100, Mike \"Sputz\" opted to decline entry into the August 18 showcase, giving another superstar a chance to headline 100. As a result, a second ticket was pulled, this time with the name of DODGEBALL 90 headliner\nJustin Pierce\n. Pierce graciously accepted the offer, becoming the first DODGEBALL 100 captain. DODGEBALL 100's next captain would come midway through DODGEBALL 90, revealing the one and only\nKevin Adams\n.\nQualified participants for the next drawing were also released at DODGEBALL 90 ...\nValerie Winston, Lenny Herrera, Alison Bertsch, Ryan McCrorey, Dan Spengeman, Sara DeCuir, Lauren Freda, Rob Avakian, Derek Carty, and Lauren Winston.\nOnline Exclusive!\nRyan Letsche, who has competed in a total of 31 events (including DODGEBALL 90), is the 21st player on the elite \"Most Times Played\" list.

For Pierce, it was his first.\n- Excluding DODGEBALL 90 new blood, the following competitors made their tenevent debut: Lindsay Gough, Jodi Holt, and Grant Cornero.\n- Kevin Adams and John Tronolone remain as the only two competitors to participate in every season finale spectacular.\n>> \"Fitz\", thanks as always for the stereo.
