  "body_text": "The most unpredictable weekend since the inception of dodgeball has just past. Two events, solid in participation and build-up, turned out to be rather unorthodox. DODGEBALL TWENTY-TWO started the downward spiral ...\nIt was being built as the third \"Wet War\". DODGEBALL 9 and especially DODGEBALL VII, were two of the most popular events ever, for one main reason; it poured. The wet weather didn't stop any of the competitors from playing dodgeball on those two nights, and many had wondered when the next \"Wet War\" would take place. It was bound to happen sooner than later, and at DODGEBALL TWENTY-TWO, \"Wet War III\" had arrived.\nHowever, depsite the innital excitement, the realization that it is dead-smack in the middle of winter hit us all. When you combine winter temperatures of 30 and below and a heavy wind easily around the 20MPH mark forcing to the rain to fall in a diagonal direction, very few could have withstanded that. It is pretty safe to say that \"Wet War III\" was really meant to be \"Ice Age I\". TWENTY-TWO would start at its normal time of 7PM. It ended the earliest of any dodgeball event ever at 8:30. The weather was just too brutal.\nDODGEBALL TWENTY-TWO could easily go down as the biggest let down of any dodgeball event. Because of it, DODGEBALL 23 would move up several days ahead of schedule. Many participants of TWENTY-TWO were dying to play, and 23 would happen just two days later. The first ever Monday Night Dodgeball would occur, making January 16th a historical day.\nIt was no shocker that less people were able to attend DODGEBALL 23. About 15 in total made their way to Wall High School, ready for the action they missed just two days before. But once again, luck was no where to be found. The dodgeball courts were completely iced-over, making them dangerous to play on. The determined group all put their thoughts together to try and figure out a way out of this mess. Attempts at playing in one of the many Wall High School gyms went stale. The next best place, despite a slight fee, was GoodSports USA on Route 138. However, that place didn't help all too much either as a Monday night was extremely busy for them, with no available courts. The night was called quits after this failed attempt and ideas of somehow gaining an indoor facility in the very near future were put on the table.\nIt was certainly an interesting turn of events, many of which will never forget. But despite the unluckiness surrounding the situations of the past weekend, one thing remains the same: the heart and passion of dodgeball is strong. Let the facts speak for themself; DODGEBALL TWENTY-TWO had a surprising 27 participants, making it the highest attendance for any \"Wet War\".\nDODGEBALL 23 will move back to its original date and time: this Saturday, January 21st. Start time is the normal 7PM. Just as a heads-up, early weather reports are already predicting rain. If that is the case, we shall simply see what happens. Similarly to this past weekend, a rescheduling can happen immediately after.\nAnd as for the DODGEBALL 23 poster, an updated version will be released later in the week.",
