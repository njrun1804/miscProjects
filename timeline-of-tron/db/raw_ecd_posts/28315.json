  "body_text": "DODGEBALL XL: Was it the \"Xtra Large\" event many were hoping for?\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe AWARDS\nThe \"ten\" events always start off with the classic \"Dodgeball Excellence\" Awards ...\n> The \"Wet War Warrior\" Award <\n*Only player to participate in all eight \"Wet Wars\"*\nSTEVE ADAMS\n> Perfect Attendance <\nLENNY HERRERA\n> Best Dressed Awards <\nCHRIS ADAMS\nROB AVAKIAN\nKEVIN MEGILL\n> Most Intense Award <\nJOE KELLY\n> Powerhouse Thrower Award <\nKEVIN MEGILL\n> Appreciation Awards <\nJUSTIN PIERCE\nKEVIN MEGILL\nThere were two other awards to be given, but neither players were in attendance at the time of the award ceremony:\n> \"Hot Hands\" Catcher <\nROB AVAKIAN\n> \"Main Event Star\" Award* <\nTOM ADAMS\n*This was based on a DODGEBALL 20 poll on who others thought should have been in inducted into the now-defunct Hall of Fame. Tom Adams was the unanimous choice. This award was to be given at DODGEBALL 30, but Tom did not attend.*\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe MATCH\nFor the third straight event, a dodgeball record, Joe Kelly was looking to continue his winning ways as leader of his team. Perhaps the most dominant captain in all of dodgeball was looking for his next big challenger, and more importantly, the victory at DODGEBALL XL. His challenger goes by the name of Travis Mills, another \"Most Intense\" Award winner. Travis's pervious run as captain was on the final stop on \"The Road to 30\", DODGEBALL 29, and his opponent was \"The Big Kat\" Zach Katz. However, Travis would not see victory on that March night and would have to wait another day for his next run. On paper, this already looked like a mismatch.\nWhat appears on paper isn't always the truth. But in this case, the paper was right. One of the biggest wins ever stamped Joe Kelly's name into the record books once again. It was a fierce battle all the way around, but the power of Joe's team prevailed and gave him his third consecutive win as captain.\nJoe Kelly defeated Travis Mills at DODGEBALL XL: 8 to 2.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe PLAYERS\nThere is no question that DODGEBALL XL saw the best female action. Ten women in all proved they too can hang with the best. From crafty veterans to intense new-comers, XL may have ushered in the era of female domination.\nThe women of XL deserve every bit of respect (in order of their debut): Diana DiBuccio, Valerie Winston, Lauren Freda, Alison Bertsch, Sara DeCuir, Lauren Stopa, Christina Guarino, Kali Beth Erstan, Angee Randazzo, and Melissa Kerr.\n- Two new-comers Kali Beth Erstan and Melissa Kerr, showed plenty of athleticism especially with in-your-face throwing abilities.\n- Diana DiBuccio's catching for the evening was superb, even grabbing one by powerhouse Kevin Fitzpatrick. Not many people can say they have done that.\n- Valerie Winston secured the first two game winners at DODGEBALL XL as her secret sideline throw puts many out of the game.\nKevin Adams has to be one of the more gifted players with all-around natural talents like throwing and dodging. His longevity in each of the games proves his toughness and stamina, but also his awareness on the court as he is a difficult player to hit.\nFamily is sometimes used to describe dodgeball as a whole. But it can also be used the traditional way, especially when referring to Bill Krott. The older brother of the legendary Mike \"Sputz\" made catching look pretty darn easy. It didn't matter who threw at him as at every second he was ready to eliminate an opponent and bring a teammate back in the game. A fearless player as well as you rarely saw him in the back of the pack.\nSteve Guarino and Lenny Weg, two of the more quiet and even younger players, have proven to be two top dogs of the sport. Playing baseball has helped each of their dodgeball \"careers\" with hard-hitting throws and quick feet.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe EXTRAS\nDon't think for one second that injuries weren't apart of DODGEBALL XL.\nTravis Mills felt the pain of a bulletball given by John Tronolone. Travis, a very crafty dodger, misstimed the dodge which sent the captain limping off to the sidelines. After about a minute, Travis was still feeling the sting from the hit. He then revealed a huge black and blue bruise, or welt if you will, on his leg.\nChristina Guarino apparently has the worst luck of any player. At DODGEBALL XXX4, she suffered a horrendous faceshot at the hands of Zach Katz, which sadly gave her a bloody nose. Some six events later, her fate was the same as she took two headshots. She was okay thankfully and continued to play.\nIt is known that Kevin Megill has arguably the hardest throw in all dodgeball, so when taking a hit by him, the effects won't be pretty. For one Zach Katz, it perhaps couldn't have been any worse. When attempting to deflect oncoming balls, Zach looked up for split second and boom! Kevin connected with unquestionably one of the worst faceshots in history. Zach fell to one knee, admitting to his face becoming numb. As he has shown in the past, his toughness is seemingly unparalleled as he got right back in the game within seconds.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe RECORDS\n> Attendance: 36\nDODGEBALL XL took third highest attendance number, fourth overall attendance. XTWO, 15, and 20 are the only events to have higher with turnouts of 42, 37, and 37, respectively.\n> Biggest Returns:\nChris Burke (Last played at DODGEBALL 17)\nMatt Haviland (Last played at DODGEBALL 23)\n> New Players: (4) Angee Randazzo, Bill Krott III, Kali Beth Erstan, and Melissa Kerr\n> Ten women participated at DODGEBALL XL. That number is only second to DODGEBALL 20 with 11.\n> Joe Kelly would be captain for the third straight time, which set a dodgeball record. Travis Mills was captain for the second time, with his first at DODGEBALL 29. Joe is now 3-0, while Travis is 0-2.\n> Video footage made its return for the first time since DODGEBALL 30.\n> \"Best Dressed\" and \"Wet War Warrior\" were the two new award categories.\n> Steve Adams, after 39 \"long\" events, showed off his new haircut.\n> In a rare occurance, all of the Adams brothers were on the same team (Team Travis).\n> Only ten players have participated in all of the past \"ten\" events and attended DODGEBALL XL: (in alphabetical order)\nAlison Bertsch\nChris Adams\nDan Spengeman\nJohn Tronolone\nJohn Watters\nKevin Adams\nMike \"Sputz\" Krott\nRyan McCrorey\nSteve Adams\nValerie Winston\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nSPECIAL THANKS\nThank you to Ryan McCrorey for bringing the radio as it always adds to the fun.\nValerie Winston is also thanked for coming early, helping with the many decorations.\nA special thanks to Dan Spengeman who not only came early to help out much like Valerie, but also video taped and took great pictures during XL. Those pictures will be released during the week.\nAgain, Kevin Megill and Justin Pierce are thanked for purchasing some of the best dodge balls around. Their \"Appreciation Awards\" were certainly deserving.\nAnd finally, thanks to\neveryone\nfor making DODGEBALL XL a true success. Over three hours of non-stop fun with colorful awards, intense music, violent action, and most importantly and never to be forgotten, friendship. WE all made DODGEBALL XL something to remember.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nOH HELL YEAH!",
