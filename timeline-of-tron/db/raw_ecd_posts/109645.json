  "body_text": "Standin' in line to the see the show tonight ...\nJacobs, Vetrano Highlight\nFA IV\nA magical journey to superstardom. A multiple-year odyssey to culimination.\nAnd the intersection at which they collide - it's\nFamily Affair IV\n!\nRookie sensation Jacobs was awarded first pick by winning the pre-match coin flip and carefully chose the dangerous, deadly force Kevin Fitzpatrick. In an effort to mirror such a solid selection, veteran Vetrano drafted Fitz's longstanding nemesis, Chris Adams. After Justin \"Punter\" Wolf, \"King\" John Tronolone, and the rest of the megastars were equally divided, the titanic-sized war of wars commenced without a hitch.\nMATCH SUMMARY\nRight from the get-go, prepped 'ballers knew this was gauranteed to be one hotly-contested confrontation. But few could accurately predict the outcome of each individual battle, even when three, or two combatants remained for either team. All it took was a strategic grab or, if available, a rim-smackin' team regeneration to turn the tide.\nProof of the encounter's tightness came in the first four games, split between the army generals. Vetrano's pivotal round 5 triumph finally generated enough momentum to capture the multi-point edge in the following bouts and secure the monumental victory.\nBobby Vetrano\ndefeated\nKenny Jacobs\n, 5 to 3, and the 4th annual\nFamily Affair\n.\nMATCH ANALYSIS\nDefensive plays may have greatly affected the outcome of the physically-taxing, four-hour showdown. Vetrano-chosen allies like Zach \"The Big Kat\" Katz, \"The Axe\" Adams, and \"The Creation\" Tronolone were key, each with a collection of wisely-timed catches. Sneaky trickshots perpetrated by Travis \"Maniac\" Mills, Devin Rich's fierce overhand throw, and the clutch performances by Lauren Stopa were extremely crucial.\nThe Jacobs-lead charge, while unable to attain the \"W\", was an adequate piece of machinery. The uncanny power behind Fitzpatrick, Wolf, and Pierce, the resilient right-handed throws from southpaw Kevin Megill, and the overall athletic efforts performed by Kelly Oberto inflicted plenty of damage upon their adversaries.\nINJURY REPORT\nOther than sore muscles, minor scrapes, and a few bruises, zero serious injuries came out of\nFamily Affair IV\n.\nFAMILY & FRIENDS\nWithout the support of those cherished loves ones, it just wouldn't be, well, a \"Family Affair\"! The cast of characters cheering in the stands was plentiful:\n\u2192 Gaile Adams and Aunt Cicely proudly represented brothers Chris and Steve Adams\n\u2192 Anthony Casbarro, afro and all, rooted for good buddy and headliner, Kenny Jacobs\n\u2192 Darrell Tronolone, \"Grandma\" Nancy Tronolone, Anthony and Darlene Pontecorvo, and beloved family friend Georgi Gilmartin clapped and applauded John Tronolone\n\u2192 Chelsie Winston, Alysha Kelly, and\nECDElitist\nLauren Winston made surprise visits\n2010 was a tremendous calendar for\nEast Coast Dodgeball\n, the eminent\nECDElite\nHall of Fame surely a reason why.
