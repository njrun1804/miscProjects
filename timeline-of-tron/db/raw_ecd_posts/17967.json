Is the \"slump\" over? ...\nThe facts tell the story ...\n> \"On the Flip Side ...\" (Differences)\nI.\nDODGEBALL XXIV had 21 players [with at least 8 spectators].

DODGEBALL XXV continued that pattern when another veteran missed his first event; the legendary Tom Adams. Tom had participated in every single event since DODGEBALL 8; his dodgeball debut.\nII.\nKevin Megill made his long awaited return at DODGEBALL XXIV, having not played since DAY 4. The biggest returns in terms of time were Valerie Winston and Ben Cotta, who were both inactive since \"The ClimaXX\", other wise known as  DODGEBALL 20.\n> \"Gore! Gore! Gore!\" (Players)\nNew player Ray Marzarella had some impressive dodges and catches during the evening. He was the captain of his respective team and led them like a true competitor. Gerald Lewis, another new comer and rival captain, was also impressive mainly for his throwing ability, especially with the bigger \"pain\" balls.\nSteve Adams came back after a one week hiatus and was a true asset on the court. He hit \"rim\" and eliminated numerous opponents by catching and throwing.\nAlthough unrelated athletically, a few players this past week have been feeling less than 100%. Two players who were noticably sick during XXV, yet still showed a tremendous amount of heart [and maybe stupidity], were John Tronolone and Derek Carty. John has been battling bronchitis since the start of last week while Derek has been up against the flu.\nAlison Bertsch, Lauren Freda, and Diana DiBuccio all caught well, proving that the ladies can and will knock down anyone in front of them.\n> \"SmackDown! vs. RAW\" (The Match)\nFor the first time in dodgeball history, new comers were captains. Gerald Lewis and Ray Marzarella picked teams basically on clothing, look, and other physical attributes. This certainly gave XXV a more random set-up. Despite the \"lottery-type\" teams, the action itself could go down as some of the best ever.\nRay and his new found friends [and more so allies] were an instant threat to \"G-Money\" (according to Gerald's shirt). The first half of XXV belonged to the high-flying prodigy, with a score of 4 to 2. But the ever powerful Gerald Lewis was far from defeat ...\nThe night's counter-strike came late though, when Lewis and company did mount an offensive close to the end of XXV. Despite the sudden turnaround, the score still stood at a two point difference. DODGEBALL XXV, one of the most misleading events in history, ended with Ray taking home the gold 6 to 4. An outstanding match-up it was.\n________________________________________\n_____\n> \"The Pre-Show\" (Diana's Dodgeball Dinner)\nOn the eve of DODGEBALL XXV, Diana DiBuccio threw an awesome \"dodgeball\" party for all past-players. Built as a \"pasta party\", the idea for the dinner was to get everyone \"carbed\" up for the following night. It was a success with excellent pasta dishes cooked by Diana's mother, Carol.\nThe activities during the night ranged. Dan Spengeman's documentary \"Not JUST a Game\" was publically viewed for the first time. It was a hit as immediate orders (for only $3) were available for purchase. It was a great way to start the night, perhaps making everyone realize that dodgeball has created many great friendships and memories. Later in the evening saw a football-like frisbee game. The weather was not as bad as it might have seemed, so numerous people went on to play outside.\nOverall, the party was a success. It started at 7PM and went to about the 1AM mark.\n________________________________________\n_____\n> \"Did You Know?\" (What to Expect)\nI.\nDODGEBALL 26 contest posters must be sent in by February 7th. The contest will take place immediately after.\nII.\nThe idea of a daytime dodgeball event has been brought up nuermous times. If anyone would like to go ahead with this idea, a date shall be planned. Until then, all events start at 7PM.\nIII.\nSchedule of events:\nSaturday, 02/11/06 ~ DODGEBALL 26\nFriday, 02/17/06 ~ DODGEBALL 27\nSaturday, 02/25/06 ~ DODGEBALL 28\nSaturday, 03/04/06 ~ DODGEBALL 29\nIV.\nDODGEBALL XXV was supposed to have a \"surprise\", thus bringing back \"history\".
