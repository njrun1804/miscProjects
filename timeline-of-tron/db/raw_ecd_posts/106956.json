  "body_text": "WALL vs. ALL 11: The Results\nPersonal rivalries, single-person showdowns, and bitter one-on-one animosity were violently kicked aside for\nEastCoastDodgeball's\n2010 Thanksgiving \"Fight Knight.\" At the forefront of the action comprised two deadly alliances each seething with nearly 24 months of pent-up frustration - the homeland WALL Knights and the daring ALL Army.\nIn this unprecedented 11th encounter, which faction would miraculously walk away unconquered?\nMATCH SUMMARY\nUpon arrival at the hallowed Wall High School battlegrounds, it was evident the ALL invaders had come properly prepared with heavy human weaponry and several surprise reinforcements. The mere sight of their starting five-man opposition had most of them chuckling before the initial weapon was even hurled! But it was the only laugh any of which would experience.\nThe 11th WALL Army was perhaps as fierce and nasty as any previous coalition assembled. Lead by veterans Fitzpatrick, Letsche, Basista, and Adams, this 8-person fortress humiliated the outnumbering ALL squad six out of the first seven vicious battles.\nCatching machine and\nECDElitist\nMike \"Sputz\", the quick and agile Tronolone Brothers, as well as newly-inducted\nElitist\n\"Crazy One\" Edwards fought valiantly to alter the tide of this shocking outcome. Every ounce of sweat and energy was drained from their systems from the experienced veterans to the less familiar, yet fearless combatants like Tim Lawrence, Kenny Jacobs, and Arthur Casbarro.\nBy the conclusion of 11 physically-taxing contests, the massive 11th ALL Army - all 18 strong - were handily sent retreating, forced to fight another day.\nTeam WALL\ndefeated\nTeam ALL\n, 8 - 3\n.\nThe Yearbook\nTeam ALL's 11th Army may have been the most diverse of any previous combination put together.
