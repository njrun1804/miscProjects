After a brief intermission, Justin \"Punter\" Wolf, Eamon Fitzpatrick, and newly-inducted\nECDElitist\nMike \"Sputz\" gained the second contest as well, giving the eldest Winston the comfortable 2 to 0 advantage.\nGame 3 was crucial for Lauren, and her supporting cast knew it, failing to throw in the towel.\nECDElitist\nJustin Pierce, along with rim-smacking Stopa and \"Crazy One\" Edwards, revived Team LAUREN enough to snatch a victory. Clearly the momentum had shifted when, in a tremendous 4th round, the younger sibling tied the historical match at 2. With time quickly winding down, the finale would ultimately determine the \"Winston Cup\" champi... ... ??\nA mere three combatants surviving for Captain Valerie kept the most storied family feud unresolved because at 9:11pm exactly, the battleground lights shut off! Looks like the sisters aren't finished just yet - \"6 Year Anniversary\" perhaps?\nEastCoastDoodgeball\nwill just have to wait.\nMore, More ..\nUnquestionably one the sport's most memorable extravaganzas yielded plenty of big-time moments and standout stars. For starters,\nTom Adams'\nthree-minute \"last man standing\" Game 2 performance - completely barefoot mind you - may have been the show-stealer.\nDarrell Tronolone's\nNFL Raiders sandals didn't stall him in hurling weapons, dodging with ease, and miraculously catching with his ankles either; not bad for 50-plus!\nPondScum's\nTurner\nand\nMarzarella\nproved durability and longevity excellence in each of the four rounds. The Yochum-crafted rims certainly took a beating, especially when\nECDElitists\nKevin Fitzpatrick\nnearly cracked them in half.\nJoanie Lima's\nsideline eliminations, newbie\nAndrew Capaci's\nimpressive grabs, the numbing faceshot perpetrated against an out-of-bounds\nChris Pedraza\n, and the crowd-pleasing, clap-happy \"I Gotta Feeling\" by the Black Eyed Peas soundtrack hit will long be remembered.\n.. and More!\nECD\npraises the following audience members! Special thanks to The Spengeman Family, Nancy \"Grandma\" Tronolone, The Pierce Family, The Fitzpatrick Family, Ms. Gail Adams and Aunt Cicely, The Krott Family, as well as Diana DiBuccio's coworkers Kathleen McGreevy and Wendy Ramas for coming out in support of this once-in-a-lifetime spectacular.\n\"...
