Concern over this deals with the current weather situation, seeing how it supposed to rain on Saturday again. Now, granted it won't be as windy as last weekend, but I think it's safe to say that this time of year, the rain and cold air don't mix all to well. I seriously need feedback on this, just so that I know everyone is aware of what might happen. If dodgeball does indeed move to this Friday, then I want to make sure it's okay with everyone else, or at least a large portion of you, the players. Please let me know immediately as its your feedback that will decide when DODGEBALL 23 will take place.\"\n>> Decision to make: The date of DODGEBALL 23\nFriday, January 20th, 2006\nSaturday, January 21st, 2006\n\"I personally am for the move to Friday, as are a few others.
