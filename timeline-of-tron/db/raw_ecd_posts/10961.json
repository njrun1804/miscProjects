The Players ...\nMatt Brown, in the eyes of many, stole the show at DODGEBALL 17. He is the youngest player in the history of this sport, playing at a tender age of 13. He threw hard, caught great, and even earned two \"garbage\" shots. Those weren't two ordinary hits though, as both actually went into the basket. An incredible performance by this rookie.\nYou also have Tom Adams, who seemingly plays well just about every week. With DODGEBALL 20/XX coming up in three weeks, could he be an inductee for the Hall of Fame?\nSteve Adams made history once again. Not only did he try to hit the garbage can a good portion of the time, but was on the giving end of one of the most violent hits ever. Valerie Winston, who was standing quietly on her side of the court, never saw it coming; a pain ball right into her face. Her expression after the hit certainly gives new meaning to the phrase \"pain\" ball.\nJohn Watters's throw in general is by far one of the best. Most would have never thought that he is only 15 years old. In John's case, \"The Future is Bright\" is a dead phrase. \"The Future is Now\" fits perectly.\nTravis Mills did the impossible at DB17; hitting the garbage when his entire team was already in. This is a first and it is very unlikely to be duplicated.\n\"The Two Justins\" provided numerous laughs during their heated rivalry. Justin Godynick tried his damndest to eliminate Justin Pierce all night long, but was unsuccessful. Every time JG threw, JP would fire back; not with a ball, but with words. There is no question that \"The Piercer\" can trash talk like no one else. This feud will no doubt continue in the upcoming weeks.\nAnd last but not least is the combination of Wesley Hebrew and Matt Larsen. For the third event in a row, the captains were exceptional. Both Wesley and Matt formed their armies and were ready for battle ...\n> 17: I\nBefore the war was to rage on, Matt Larsen chose Lauren Freda as a fellow teammate, thus splitting up the almost unseparable duo of Chris Adams and Lauren herself. The idea came straight from the mind of one KJohn Tronolone. This marks only the second time the Hall of Fame couple have been on opposing sides. The first came at DODGEBALL 9, when Captain KJohn chose Lauren as his first pick; his rival captain that night was none other than Chris Adams.\nNow onto the game ...\nOnce again, the match was dead even all the way to the end. With a score of 3 to 3, a final decisive game was ready to begin.\nIt was in that last game where Matt Larsen, accompanied by his elite force, prevailed. However, the now famous phrases \"one more game\" and \"last game\" came about.\nAfter the supposed defeat of one Wesley Hebrew, the counter-strike was launched. Dodgeball, which normally ends at 10PM, continued past that mark [for the second week in a row]. Wesley's team certainly wanted a rematch, as well as Matt and his already \"victorious\" allies. Larsen however was only victorious for a mere 5 minutes, as Wesley secured what would truly be the final game in this unforgettable series. A tie \"concluded\" DODGEBALL 17; 4 to 4.\n> 17: II\nEven though it was after 10PM, the mayhem continued. In the second part of the night, brothers Kyle and Derek Carty formed new teams. Although a number of players had left, the teams were still quite large making for more dodgeball fun. Every single game was said to be \"the last game\", but once again, things didn't turn out that way.\n> 17: III\nSara DeCuir, who played in the first part of the night, came back after missing the action in the second. She returned to her surprise as a captain and her rival for this third portion of the long night was Alison Bertsch. It was a quick series that ended in complete chaos; the lights had finally shut off! Mayhem was at hand and allowed the remaining 13 players to fire balls at one another in the dark.\nDODGEBALL 17 could have broken the record for the longest event ever. The only one to compare it to is DODGEBALL X, which begin one hour earlier the normal starting time.\n17 did break the record for the most number of captains in a single night (6). Three mammouth challenges broke out that made DB17 a phenomenal event. It also broke the record for the latest event, ending at 11PM.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nGet Inside the Game\nI.\nAs soon as DODGEBALL 19 concludes, the official countdown to the biggest dodgeball extravaganza of all time will begin.

They realize the weather isn't getting any better, so they have offered time in their schedules to get coffee, tea, etc. for all players.\nIII.\nAfter a week long wait, the DODGEBALL X6 pictures have finally been released to the public.
