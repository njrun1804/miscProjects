  "body_text": "For fans accross the world, this is the very first entry posted from the DiBuccio Residence.\nIt was the rematch the world thought they would never see.\nAt DODGEBALL 20, two of the youngest, most gifted athletes were given the special \"Prodigy Award\". Four events later at DODGEBALL XXIV, they went head-to-head in captains competition, with the outcome a complete mystery!\nTo this day, it is still unknown who won on that fateful January night. But in the world of dodgeball, never say never. Their return match would come soon enough.\n~~~ Prodigy Captains Rematch: Lenny Herrera vs. Matt Brown II\nFrom start to finish, DODGEBALL LVII was nothing short of intense. Lenny and Matt certainly formed some strong alliances, thus making for a clash of epic proportions.\nIt started rather easily for young Brown as the first four games went to him. The night looked grim for Lenny as he would have to mount perhaps the biggest comeback ever if he wanted to walk out the victor.\nAs luck [and skill] would have it, the surprise of all surprises came in the remaining games of DODGEBALL LVII. It was obvious Matt had formed a solid team, but would somehow fail to win another game for the rest of the night. Because of this almost unrealistic retaliation, Lenny would go on to win at DODGEBALL LVII!\nSimplified version of each game:\nGame 1:\nMatt wins\nGame 2:\nMatt wins\nGame 3:\nMatt wins\nGame 4:\nMatt wins\nGame 5:\nLenny wins\nGame 6:\nLenny wins\nGame 7:\nLenny wins\nGame 8:\nLenny wins\nGame 9:\nLenny wins\nGame 10:\nLenny wins\nThere was no mystery about this one. Lenny Herrera defeated Matt Brown at DODGEBALL LVII in a rematch from DODGEBALL XXIV. The final score was 6 to 4.\n~~~ Prodigy \"Awards\" at LVII\nAt DODGEBALL FIFTY-FIVE, a group of six WHS Freshman wanted a piece of the action they saw looking in from the outside. Their many talents were noticed immediately, but little did anyone know that a mere two weeks later, two of those very six \"prodigies\" would return to the dance. At the tender age of 14, Andrew D. and Chris Y. showcased those very abilities that made them famous on that September 9th night. Maybe with the exception of John Watters and Matt Brown, few at their age can pack in as much force into each throw as they can. Superb catching ability was also shown by Chris, grabbing many  at DODGEBALL LVII.\nJohn Tronolone may have been the star performer at DODGEBALL LVII. In six consecutive games, he was the last remaining player on his team. Fighting through fatigue and more-so stiff competition, he managed to pick-off players one by one, earning several rimshots in the process. Much credit to this high-flyin' dodger as he has competed in all 57 events and is still at the top of his game.\nDan Coran was an impact player for sure. Though he attends only on occasion, truth be told he is one of dodgeball's brightest, most noted for his impressive bulletball catches. Keep in mind, he is only in his mid to late teens.\n~~~ LVII Records\n- Attendance: 25\n- Biggest Returns:\nSteve Kass (Last played at DODGEBALL 35)\nDan Coran (Last played at DODGEBALL XL)\n- New Players: (2) Brian D and Justin W\n- DODGEBALL LVII returned to the back tennis courts of WHS, with inclusion of human rims.\n- Only one female participated in the action at DODGEBALL LVII: Sara DeCuir. This is rather ironic as the past week, as well as the forthcoming event are in tribute to the women of dodgeball. (This also set the record for lowest female turnout as well.)\n- Matt Brown is now 0-1-1 as captain. Lenny improves his record: 3-1-1.\n- The connection between the captains within the past three weeks is rather interesting as well. Robert Brown (FIFTY-FIVE), Lindsay Gough (LVI), and Matt Brown (LVII) have been captain: they have all lost.\n~~~ Schedule\nDODGEBALL LVIII is Saturday, September 30 at WHS (6:30)\nDODGEBALL 59/LIX is Friday, October 6 at WHS (6:30)\nDODGEBALL LX is Saturday, October 14 at WHS (6pm)\nDODGEBALL 61 is Saturday, October 21 at WHS (6:30)\n~~~ Get ready for DODGEBALL LVIII\nThe preview for LVIII will pay tribute to the remaining six legendary women on the poster. Check back during the week!",
