ADAMS & MEGILL with Incomparable Stakes!\nChris Adams and John Tronolone knew what they had to do.\nEight previous battles\n, equal to nearly a half-decade of captaincy embarrassment, had left each seething for vengeance and this time they were willing to risk everything for one final opportunity.\nThe brutal mayhem began instantly, testing the heart, desire, and physical determination of the four leading generals and their respective soldiers.\nPondScum\nphenom Dan Turner, first lady of dodgeball Diana DiBuccio, and first overall selection Kevin Fitzpatrick, specifically, were instrumental in the adrenaline-pumping inaugural round helping the arrogant, yet confident \"C&J\" alliance prevail. The sophomore contest duplicated such a result, placing the odds thoroughly against the dynamite K. Adams/Megill coalition. Would the formidable \"Double K\" force grab hold the pivotal third game?\nIn an improbable, down-to-the-wire victory, \"The Axe\" Adams chopped his competition while \"The Creation\" recreated the destructive scenes of his early days, turning back \"Kevin & Kevin\" to narrowly capture this crucial round - and the next! With only a limited amount of time to spare, Dr. K. Adams and \"KMJ\" regrouped and re-energized in the fifth and final contest in an attempt to  prevent the shocking near-shutout; \"Crazy One\" Edwards, \"Maniac\" Mills, and one hungry, nasty Wolf assisted in the successful effort.\nIn a do-or-die, now-or-never situation to preserve their captaincies,\nChris Adams and John Tronolone\nfinally defeated\nKevin Adams and Kevin Megill\n, 4 to 1.\nNearly five years of incredible history, arguably the four most iconic figures ever, three hours of heart-pounding action, two armies vying for revenge, just this once .. this was \"Immaculate Redemption.\"\nCareers vs. Streaks\nThere have only been four\nWhite Flag\ncontests and in each, John Tronolone has miraculously come out victorious. His legendary co-captain, Chris Adams, became only the second leading general in\nECD\nhistory to emerge with his hand raised in triumph with the dreaded stipulation on the line.\nThe surprising outcome for the pair of Kevins is something not seen since double-digit events eons ago. Kevin Adams suffered his first defeat since\nDODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO\nin late-summer 2006 and was on a 5-match winning streak en route to the August 14th collision. Kevin Megill's only loss prior to \"Immaculate Redemption\" was at\nDODGEBALL 80\nin March 2007.\nOnline Exclusive!\n\"Immaculate Redemption\" was not only scheduled prior to July's \"Family Affair 2010\", but originally the latter's aftermath event. Additionally, in realizing that the month of August has always produced the sport's major match-ups, \"The Writer\" felt the need to continue such tradition. The encounter itself, however, wasn't officially booked until August 1 once each of the participants mutually agreed.\nRecords and Recognition\nAttendance\n: 31, comprised of 21 men and 10 women.\nNew Dodgeballers\n: Gina Asprocolas, John Sickles, Ryan Rafferty, Tim Moore\nGame Rules\n: Classic two-team.\nFeatured Match\n: Chris Adams and John Tronolone defeated Kevin Adams and Kevin Megill, 4 - 1, in a\nWhite Flag\nMatch. Had C. Adams and Tronolone lost, each would have been forced to retire their captaincy.\nGame-By-Game Results\n: C. Adams/Tronolone 1-4; K. Adams/Megill 5\nCaptains Records\n: C. Adams 7-7-0, Tronolone 8-9-0, K. Adams 9-3-0, Megill 7-2-1.\nPlay of the Night\n: Jason Teitelbaum's fearless diving deflection catch received a deserving applause from the crowd.\nPlayer of the Night\n: Impressive dodges and high impact throws proved the high talent level of new sensation Ryan Rafferty.\nCredits\nStory\n: \"The Writer\"\nSoundtrack\n: Diana DiBuccio\nTheme Song\n: \"Once\" by Pearl Jam\nNext Event\n: \"5 Year Anniversary\" on September 11, 2010, at 5:30pm.\n________________________________________\n___________________________",
