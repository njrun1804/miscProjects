DODGEBALL LXXXVI had all the ingredients of a true classic. Violent, painful faceshots, super-glue and even one-handed catches, magnificent dodging displays, and above all else, the drive and heart of every competitor.\nMatch Summary\nWe've all heard it ... \"an evenly contested bout, that could have gone either way.\" But it's a perfect fit to one extraordinary night.\nThe arduous three-hour clash of warriors began with Grant and his so-called BLACK Team picking up the kick-off game of LXXXVI. A fine start for the inexperienced captain.\nCome Game 2, the initial success Grant earned was taken away almost immediately, as the veteran Kevin and the WHITE Team fought long and hard the next couple of rounds. At the end of four, it was 3 to 1, a solid lead in favor of the Season 1 veteran Adams. With time still remaining, anything was possible.\nLXXXVI's final two contests came down to the wire. Combatants were on their toes during Game 5, eventually won by Grant. But it just wasn't enough as the sixth game saw the opposite - the death nail in the coffin of the BLACK Team.\n2005 mogul Kevin Adams's past knowledge and strategy prevailed in this epic encounter over the resourceful and daring 2007 headliner Grant Cornero.\n-->\nGrant's victories\n: 1, 5\n-->\nKevin's victories\n: 2, 3, 4, 6\nOnline Exclusive!\nIn the weeks leading up to the match, Grant became interested in picking teams under\nPick Your Poison\nRules. Kevin felt it would be best if traditional team formations applied. Grant would go on to accept regular team selections as was seen at DODGEBALL LXXXVI.\nMoments & Stars\n: Diana DiBuccio's two vicious faceshots in a matter of minutes; Sascha Basista's reckless and rather comedic dodges; super-glue catches from Mike \"Sputz\" as well as Kevin Fitzpatrick\nThe 86th Records\n> Attendance: 20\n> Biggest Return: Wesley Hebrew (Last appearance at DODGEBALL LXXXI)\n> New Players: (1) Tim Caradonio\n- DODGEBALL LXXXVI took place on\nCinco de Mayo\n.\n- It was held on the Back Courts of Wall High School for the third consecutive week. It featured Human Rims for the second consecutive week.\n- Similarly to the last few events, LXXXVI included just 6 complete games.\n- DODGEBALL LXXXVI witnessed Kevin Adams's record-setting sixth captains victory overall. He is the first person in history to accomplish this feat. His record is 6-2-0. This was Grant's debut match.\nCOMING UP NEXT ...\nDODGEBALL 87: Sister vs. Sister\nIt's a family affair at the 87th extravaganza!
