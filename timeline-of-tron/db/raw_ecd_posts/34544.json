  "body_text": "> Attendance: 20\n> New Players: 0\n> Biggest Return: Dan Fitzpatrick (Last played at DODGEBALL XLIV)\n> DODGEBALL 49 was \"Wet War X\".\n> DODGEBALL 49 was the sixth consecutive event played on the WHS Back Courts.\n> Kevin Adams's captain record after 49: 2-1 ... John Tronolone's captain record after 49: 1-4\n> John Tronolone joined the likes of Steve Adams, Sara DeCuir, and Joe Kelly for the most number of times as captain: 5 total.\n>>>\nKevin Adams vs. John Tronolone\n<<<\n\"And he did it, for the Wooorrrlllddd Heavyweight Championship!\"\nKevin Adams, at DODGEBALL 49, defeated the legendary John Tronolone in arguably the closest match is dodgeball history.\nPlayers of all ages and sizes fought through injury and pain, all in hopes to capture the very crown for their leading captain. Many would agree that the single force that led Kevin to victory was his team's uncanny ability to catch, most notably by Lenny Herrera and Kevin Megill.\nThe match itself as already mentioned couldn't have been closer. The score was dead even at 4 apeice at 10:06. John, who was suffering from \"teammate departure\", literally begged his allies to stay in order for him to capture the very championship he so wished to hold. But all the begging and \"crying\" in the world couldn't have helped him because despite his teammates decision to remain until event's end, they were defeated in the final games of the night. The score put Kevin two ahead: 6 to 4.\nKevin Adams is going to DODGEBALL 50 as\nthe\nUndisputed Champion of the world.\n>>>\nMen of Steel\n<<<\nLenny Herrera and Kevin Megill were probably the two biggest obstacles that stood in John's way. Both of them caught a tremendous number of dodge balls, thrown by some of the hardest throwers in the league. On top of that, their aim for the event was also superb, hitting a good number of players and sending them over to the sidelines.\nDan Fitzpatrick's second try at dodgeball was rather successful to say the least. Taking after his older brother, \"Powerhouse Thrower\" award winner Kevin Fitzpatrick, Dan's accuracy was perhaps the best seen at DODGEBALL 49. No matter where he was standing on the court, he was constantly eliminating opponents.\nMike Edwards, also a two-timer, further proved his skills to be top notch. One of the best dodgers on the court, he was able to fend off all enemies no matter how dangerous. His arm is also impressive, packing in a tremendous amount of force.\n>>>\nBadly Beaten\n<<<\nMuch like past events in this season alone, DODGEBALL 49 saw its share of injuries.\nIf they didn't have something in common before, they sure do now. Chris Burke, Dan Spengeman, and as of DODGEBALL 49, Mike \"Sputz\" can all say they have suffered a broken finger because of dodgeball. \"Sputz\" remained on the court however, fighting through the pain. A true test of strength for the legend himself and a performance to be admired. There will be more information in the coming week regarding this very incident.\nLenny Herrera, the man responsible for \"Sputz's\" fracture, also took a licking at DODGEBALL 49. After having several dodge balls launched at him at once, it was Tom Adams's ball that collided into his face. A few seconds had passed and everyone around couldn't help but notice the blood dripping from his nose. But being the pioneer that is his, he cleaned himself up, and got back onto the court in just minutes time. This youngster's days are far from over.\n>>>\nAnd then there was One!\n<<<\nDODGEBALL 50 is just around the corner. Literally, the biggest event of all-time hits Ocean Road Park on Friday, August 4th. Start time is 5pm: Please be on time!\nAs much as this will be a classic competitive event, it will also be more of a celebratory party. Games, contests, \"water\", and much, much more will highlight DODGEBALL 50.\nThe previews will begin this week.",
