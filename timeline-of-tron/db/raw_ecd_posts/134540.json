  "body_text": "\u2739 PRODUCTION\n12 Year Anniversary: The Great Adventure\nwill be the 210th East Coast Dodgeball presentation scheduled for Saturday, September 2, 2017 at the Wall High School tennis courts in Wall Township, New Jersey beginning at 6pm. It will be the 9th Anniversary Major championship, 12th under the August/Anniversary specials, and 57th Major overall.\nThe 12YA will feature one main bout and one secondary contest that involve players and spectators.\n\u2739 MAIN EVENT & HEADLINERS\nThe predominant attraction for the evening will see\nKevin Adams, Kevin Megill, and Christopher Adams versus John Tronolone, Tom Adams, and Kevin Fitzpatrick\nin a standard 3-vs-3 captains confrontation. This will be just the 9th triple alliance encounter in ECD history.\nAccording to ECD's behind-the-scenes organizer, The Writer, the primary attraction \"truly might be 'the one.'\" He also highlighted the leading generals as \"the biggest, the baddest, and the best.\" Opposing captains have direct opponents:\n|| KEVIN ADAMS vs. JOHN TRONOLONE ||\n- Most Majors headlined in ECD history\n(9 - K. Adams; 10 - Tronolone)\n- Most Major match victories\n(6 each)\nand Major battles won\n(43 - K. Adams; 45 - Tronolone)\n- Most match wins overall, Major or standard\n(11 - K. Adams; 9 - Tronolone)\nThis will be the third direct head-to-head encounter between the Major wins leaders. Adams presently holds slim 2-1 (match) and 13-12 (battles) advantages. While they are tied 1-1 in Major matches, Tronolone narrowly leads 8-7 in Major battles. Both men are vying to become the first captain to capture an unprecedented 7th Major title, with Tronolone also chasing a record 5th consecutive Major triumph, a milestone he prevented Adams from attaining in their last meeting. It should also be noted that Adams has never lost to the same opponent twice.\n|| KEVIN MEGILL vs. TOM ADAMS ||\n- Only unbeaten Holiday Major captains, minimum 2 matches\n(ECD166, ECD198 - Megill; ECD117, ECD207 - T. Adams)\n- \"Top 5\" ranked players all-time\n(No. 3 - Megill; No. 5 - T. Adams)\n- \"Top 5\" ranked specifics all-time\n(No. 1 catcher - Megill; No. 3 offense - T. Adams)\nMegill and Adams previously met at the 10 Year Anniversary in 2015 as indirect adversaries. Adams' alliance came out victorious, perpetrating the most painful loss of Megill's career (7-2) and denied him the captaincy \"Triple Crown\", that is winning 1-v-1, 2-v-2, and 3-v-3 matches. At the 12 Year Anniversary, they meet as direct opponents for the first time ever. Adams seeks a record-tying 2nd Anniversary trophy; Megill attempts to avoid an ECD-worst 0-3 in August/Anniversary events.\n|| CHRISTOPHER ADAMS vs. KEVIN FITZPATRICK ||\n- Featured in \"Greatest Rivalry\" Lists\n(No. 1 in 2017, 2015, & 2012)\n- Featured in 2015's \"Greatest Matches\" List\n(No. 2 @ ECD184, No. 3 @ ECD115, No. 6 @ ECD105)\n- Most Majors headlined overall versus same male opponent\n(4 @ ECD70, ECD 105, ECD115, ECD184)\nThe enduring feud between Chris Adams and Kevin Fitzpatrick has been called \"\nthe\nrevolutionary rivalry that altered behind-the-scenes booking\" and \"the\ntrue\nfoundation of captains warfare.\" Three of their intense encounters were as direct rivals. Fitzpatrick currently has a 16-11 edge over Adams having won their 1st and 3rd meetings. Adams secured a memorable tie-breaker to vanquish Fitzpatrick in their 2nd bout held under \"Creamation Rules.\" In a 2015 interview, both participants requested one last \"dream match\" against the other.\n|| ADDITIONAL HONORS & NOTES ||\nECD's statisticians have discovered several historical points of interest pertaining to the headliners as each ...\n... made their debut in 2005 during the Ocean Road Park era, the first triple alliance match-up to feature all six from said time.\n... have amassed 100+ appearances, another triple alliance first and most collectively in a single captains bout.\n... are members of the\nECDElite\nHall of Fame\n(2010 C. Adams, K. Adams, Fitzpatrick, Megill; 2011 Tronolone; 2013 T. Adams)\n... have completed the \"Career Grand Slam\" of captaincy, that is headlining all 4 Majors: Season Finale, August/Anniversary, Mid-Season Main Event, and Holiday Special\n(2008 Tronolone; 2010 C. Adams, Megill; 2011 Fitzpatrick; 2015 T. Adams; 2016 K. Adams)\n. This will be the first and possibly last ECD main event where all captains have already completed the CGS.\n\u2739 PROJECTED SUPPORTING CAST\nNumerous past and present ECD players are planning to attend including Diana DiBuccio, Justin Pierce, M. Sputz Krott, Lauren Stopa, Melissa Kerr, Michael Edwards, Grant Cornero, Justin Wolf, Sara DeCuir, Alysha Kelly, Dan Turner, Sascha Basista, Kelly Oberto, Robert Knott, and Leah Nittoso.\n\u2739 EVENT EXTRAS\nJust for attending, each player and spectator will receive one free raffle ticket good for a special $20 mystery gift card prize.
