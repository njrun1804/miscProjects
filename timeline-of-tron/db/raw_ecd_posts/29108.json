  "body_text": "It was just one week ago that the unforgettable DODGEBALL XL took place, held at the renown Wall High School tennis courts. It was almost known ahead of time that DODGEBALL XL would be a spectacle, which it indeed was. Season 4 went out with a bang.\nWith the conclusion of one season, begins the next. The very first event in what is arguably the most significant season, Season V, can not be summed up in a short parapraph. The events of DODGEBALL 41 will forever be remembered ...\nThe Captains Crown: Derek Carty challenges Joe Kelly!\nJoe Kelly has been unstoppable ever since he first became captain at DODGEBALL 38. Over the next three events, the amount of pain inflicted upon his opponents has given him bragging rights for life.  He defeated three of the biggest names ever in succession; Sara DeCuir, Ryan Letsche, and Travis Mills. It was often questioned who his next challenger would be after his victory over \"Maniac\" Mills.\nAs the build-up for DODGEBALL 41 began, only one man spoke up, challenging \"Most Intense\" award winner Kelly. That man is unquestionably one of the most recognized and certainly gifted atheletes in the game, the high-flyin' Derek Carty. In an attempt to break Kelly's 3-0 [consecutive] record, Derek would have to form a seemingly unbeatable team. As the first ball was thrown, World War III had begun!\nWhat a war; both teams very evenly matched, with wins earned back and forth. As time passed though, Derek seemed to have things going his way. At one point duuring the battle, he was up by two (5-3). Derek's fifth victory however would also be his last as the remainder of the event belonged to a determined, and somewhat injured, Joe Kelly. The final match of the evening saw a 5 to 5 tie, with the lights going out right in the middle of it. But the match shockingly continued using three yellow parking lights!\nWith elimations piling up on both teams, the most crucial rim shot of the night was hit by a Kelly ally. Derek was left with only two members on his team; Lauren Winston and John Tronolone. Both of them tried valiantly to hit their own rim and keep the game alive. But with Lauren's elimination left John by himself to face an army at full strength. His final attempt at rim fell short, ending the game with an incredible double-diving catch by both Ryan Letsche and Chris Adams. World War III had seen its end.\nIt one of the biggest matches in dodgeball history, Joe Kelly defeated Derek Carty, 6 to 5.\nSergeants, Colonels, and Generals\nThe determined captain Derek Carty proved to the world that he is among the best of the best. What an all-around performance by the high-flyer. His throws were impactful, catches made with ease, and aerial dodges that kept him on the court. Without question, one of the greatest displays of dodgeball ever.\nA teammate of Derek was that of Dan Spengeman, who's unmirrored blocking abilities had him outlast just about all players. He certainly eliminated his share of players as well as an impressive rimshot during the night.\nNew player Jessica Green is as tough as they come. On her debut night, her accuracy was the key to her success.\nAnother famale that made a splash on her debut night was Jamie Gumann. She perhaps used her silence to silence her opposition, most notably the legendary Kevin Fitzpatrick catching two of his throws.\nDODGEBALL 41 main catcher was without a doubt Steve Adams. His many taunts, as well as wildly running to the front, perhaps caused a bit of confusion in his opponents. Thinking that he wouldn't catch so close, many fell pray to his antics, and more-so strategy. A solid performance by the fearless third eldest Adams brother.\nSara DeCuir, perhaps the most resilient female player in history, also put on a show. Her high level of intensity and stamina is rarely seen among many, two attributes that have kept her at the top. With a good number of hits and grabs, she played a major role at DODGEBALL 41.\nChris Luich (sp) stepped onto the dodgeball playing grounds for the first time and immediately established a very respected reputation for himself. Here's a new player that, not knowing what to expect, put fear in the eyes of his enemies. With an extremely powerful arm and glue-like hands, he kept many enemies off the court.\nKevin Fitzpatrick, certainly a key player in the success of Joe Kelly at DODGEBALL 41, has been a heavy-hitter since day one. Most recognized for his forceful throws, the quick and agile veteran caught his share of dodge balls too. Despite suffering some minor bruising early on, that surely did not stop him.\nThe Victims\nDuring the monumental match between Joe Kelly and Derek Carty, the first hour was rough for three competitors, and that's an understatement.\nKevin Fitzpatrick's swift dodges keep him in the game longer than most as it's easily one of his finest attributes. But sometimes things tend to backfire. One particular dodge kept the Powerhouse Thrower down for a few seconds having landed hard on the pavement. Steve Adams's described the fall as a \"wrestler taking a bad bump\". Fitz as always showed his true strength, resuming play in just seconds.\n\"The King of Captains\" Joe Kelly also took a spill during DODGEBALL 41, as an attempt to dodge a ball left his ankle in bad shape. Thankfully, he did not seriously injure himself and he continued the fight against Derek Carty for the rest of the night.\nAnd then we have Chris Burke. In an effort to catch a bulletball, he ... well, read for yourself:\n...Dislocated it, broke it, tore all the ligaments, damaged the tendon. Gonna need surgery so it stays put because right now with no ligaments it keeps dislocating...\n-Chris Burke (May 28th, 3:29pm.)\nFor those that don't know what he's talking about it, just look at his finger. He is certainly wished a speedy recovery!\nToo Big for a Book\n> Attendance: 47 (New Record!)\nAfter 203 days, almost seven months, the all-time attendance record has been broken, previously held at DODGEBALL XTWO with an amazing 42.\n> New Players: 15 (New Record!) Alex H, Austin V, Chris L, Collin, Cortlund, David, Jamie G, Jessica G, Margo, Nick M, Pat D, Paul V, Sean M, Spencer, Zach S.\nBoth DODGEBALL DAY 2 and DODGEBALL XXV previously had the most new players, both with 11.\n> Biggest Return: Amanda Rose (Last played at DODGEBALL 30)\n> Included in the attendance was a new female participation record of 13. The previous record stood at 11 at the historic DODGEBALL 20.\n> Joe Kelly's record after DODGEBALL 41 is now an unmatched 4-0, beginning at ORP event, DODGEBALL 38. Derek Carty, despite a solid attendance record, had only previously been captain one other time. At DODGEBALL XIV, he lost to Ben Cotta 7 to 2. Derek's record is now 0-2.\n> \"Dark\" Dodgeball, one of the less known game-types if you will, returned at DODGEBALL 41 as the main court lights shut off at 11 o'clock during the tie-breaker match. \"Dark\" Dodgeball, for those unaware, was created at DODGEBALL 17.\n......\nDODGEBALL 41 ... Literally, the Largest Event Ever.\nDODGEBALL 42: Who's Next?\nDODGEBALL 41 shattered three all-time records. Its successor is perhaps high in expectation. Whatever the case, DODGEBALL 42 is approaching fast.\nJoe Kelly at DODGEBALL 41 solidified himself as the most successful captain of all-time. He has defeated four of the biggest names ever, in succession. His next opponent is one of the most gifted and yet younger players, having never missed an event. The challenge was layed-down at the conclusion of DODGEBALL 41 and the match has been set:\nJOE KELLY vs. LENNY HERRERA\nDODGEBALL 42\nSunday, June 4th, 2006\nOcean Road Park\n3pm Start Time\nCan Joe make it 5-0?",
