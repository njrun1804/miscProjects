  "body_text": "WOW.\nHow does one even begin to describe DODGEBALL LX3 as a whole? An invasion, a tournament, a proverbial all-star game: LX3 will forever be remembered as one of the greatest events in the history of dodgeball. Some are already calling it the best non-ten event ever, even going as far as putting it among the unforgettable ten-events themself.\nDODGEBALL LX3 can accurately be outlined as having three main parts. First the highly-anticipated invasion of unknowns ...\n-- Part I:\nLX3 Invasion!\nFor a good number of consecutive weeks, messages and comments had been posted here on\ndodgeball.livejournal.com\n, claiming an apparent invasion or attack was imminent. Who these perpetrators were became the main question asked among many of dodgeball's veterans. Would they have a small group of 5 or a mass of 20-plus?\nIn a shocking occurance, the planned invasion turned out to be more a colossal return for several past players; Dan Turner, Ray Marzarella, and Gerald Lewis, otherwise known as\nPond Scum\n! Pond Scum, specifically Dan Turner, were the ones responsible for the remarks and threats left here on\ndodgeball.livejournal.com\n, shaking up the very foundations of dodgeball itself. And though they sparked much frustration and perhaps even anger, their returns couldn't have come at a more appropriate time. Past veterans, much like themselves, came out of the woodworks, remerging into the dodgeball scene for the first time in months.\nDan Turner, perhaps in an effort to throw off anyone who suspected PS to be the antagonists, was already on the court. Those who anxiously awaited the attack couldn't help but notice four bodies walking towards the far tennis courts. The pre-game warm-ups stopped and jaws dropped as the challenge was made for a handicap match! Though Pond Scum included five players, they were fearless in their attempt to take down the mighty confrontation that lay before them.\nTheir opponent was nothing short of an allstar line-up. Could Pond Scum withstand the onslaught of a 13 person counter-strike?\nMuch credit is given to the gutsy army Pond Scum as although outnumbered, they fought valiantly throughout the first portion of DODGEBALL LX3. East Coast Dodgeball prevailed 3 games to Pond Scum's 0. But how the night was young ...\n-- Part II:\nLX3 Four Team War!\nAfter the invasion was haulted, a majority spoke up in favor of a 4 team tournament, the likes of which hadn't been seen since D-DAY 5* over one year ago. It wasn't hard to choose army generals for this one as Pond Scum yet again took center stage.\nTeam RAY\n:\nCaptain\nRay Marzarella, Alison Bertsch, Kevin Megill, Brendan Fitzpatrick, Ben Cotta, Kevin Adams.\nTeam DAN\n:\nCaptain\nDan Turner, Jesse Paxton, John Tronolone, Joe McCormick, Diana DiBuccio, Kevin Fitzpatrick.\nTeam GERALD\n:\nCaptain\nGerald Lewis, Ryan McCrorey, Kerrin Marchese, Jim Butler, Joe Kelly, Jim Martin.\nTeam KYLE\n:\nCaptain\nKyle Hirschklau, Lauren Stopa, Chris Daly, Tom Adams, Justin Pierce, Rob Avakian, Cristie Grabow.\nFirst Round Matches:\nTeam RAY defeated Team KYLE.\nTeam DAN defeated Team GERALD.\nSecond Round Matches: Winners vs. Losers / Winners vs. Losers\nTeam RAY defeated Team GERALD.\nTeam DAN defeated Team KYLE.\nFinal Round Matches: Winners vs. Winners / Losers vs. Losers\nTeam KYLE defeated Team GERALD.\nTeam RAY defeated Team DAN.\nFinal Standings\nTeam GERALD: 0-3\nTeam KYLE: 1-2\nTeam DAN: 2-1\nTeam RAY: 3-0 (Champions)\nTeam captain Ray Marzarella defeated Pond Scum teammate-turned rival Dan Turner in the final round of the four team tournament.\n-- The RAY vs. DAN match took roughly about 20, maybe 30 minutes. During this time, an exhibition rematch between teams GERALD and KYLE started up again.\nWhat happened next, you ask ... ?\n-- Part III:\nLX3 All-Star Game!\nAs if LX3 could have gotten any better, it did. The event had already broken record after record, saw the most intense action in ages, and witnessed an invasion that sparked up a revival even for a single night. But for some, more so the veterans, tradition always plays a major role. There wasn't a better way to end DODGEBALL LX3 with a classic, and yes, brutal full-blown war between the teams involved in the tournament.\n--- Team GERALD would join forces with champs Team RAY to take on a mammouth team in its own right, Team KYLE and runner-up Team DAN.\nThe competition was raised yet again as the traditional ways of the game were felt round the court in every player. From wily veterans Kevin Adams and John Tronolone to returning superstars Joe Kelly, Joe McCormick, and Chris Daly, to debuting athletes Kyle Hirschklau and Brendan Fitzpatrick, it was an all-out war fought for team pride and glory.\nThe conclusion of an already action packed, in-your-face DODGEBALL LX3 witnessed a tie! Both megateams earned 2 wins before night's end.\nCo-captains GERALD and RAY tied co-captains KYLE and DAN, 2 - 2.\nLX3 Records Section\n- Attendance: 29\n- New Players: (3) Brendan Fitzpatrick, Cristie Grabow, Kyle Hirschklau.\n- Biggest Returns:\nJoe McCormick (Last played at DODGEBALL 19) [one of the biggest returns ever]\nGerald Lewis (Last played at DODGEBALL XXX4)\nChris Daly (Last played at DODGEBALL 42)\nJoe Kelly (Last played at DODGEBALL 42)\n- DODGEBALL LX3 is perhaps viewed as the second event to include the likes of three official matches. The so-called \"US vs. THEM\", the 4-team tourny, and lastly followed by the combined team battle. DODGEBALL 17 in December of 2005 also included three seperate matches.\n- DODGEBALL LX3, for the first time since D-DAY 5*, included a 4-team tournament.\n- DODGEBALL LX3 featured only the third [officially recorded] team battle following Tom & Chris Adams vs. Kevin & Steve Adams at DODGEBALL 50 and Sara DeCuir & Dan Spengeman vs. Mark Enwistle & John Tronolone at DODGEBALL LX three weeks ago.\n- There were no rims used during the invasion match and the tournament. Human rims were brought in during the team battle though.\n- Thanks to Kevin Megill, at least six new bulletballs were tried for the very first time.\n- The Fitzpatrick clan added yet another player to the roster with 14-year old Brendan. He joins the likes of his older brothers Dan and legend Kevin.\n- The reason \"D-DAY 5\" has an asterisk after it is in reference to both the 4-team tourny and co-captains team battle. After D-DAY 5 concluded, it has only been believed and not\nofficially\nrecorded or recognized that a 4-team tournament similiar to LX3 took place on that September 24th, 2005 night. This belief simply comes from the players that were in attendance for that very event.\n- Though she didn't attend, DODGEBALL LX3 was played on Sara DeCuir's 21st birthday.\n- Following the invasion at DODGEBALL LX3, Dan Turner informed John Tronolone that more Pond Scum allies were scheduled to appear. However, many of them canceled prior to LX3.\nLX3 Moments\nUsually included in the results, one can't help but notice a special section devoted to top stars. This time around however, it is only fitting to include a few happenings/moments at perhaps the greatest non ten-event ever:\n- The weather being rather warm for mid-November.\n- The anticipation all competitors felt before the arrival of the invaders.\n- John Tronolone being the first player eliminated of LX3, thanks to Pond Scum opponent Kyle Hirschklau after catching John's painball.\n- Kathryn Nogueira getting hit hard in the boob even though she wasn't playing. Thank Kevin Adams for this incident.\n- The new silver bulletball becoming the most popular dodge ball of the evening.\n- Cristie Grabow's many eliminations thanks to her accuracy\n- Ray Marzarella getting hit square in the rearend after bending over the tennis net. Tom Adams did the damage.\n- Diana DiBuccio's sheer joy after catching a rocket from Kevin Megill.\n- An unknown car that decided to show up and start some trouble. (According to several players, they were \"high\".)\n- Pizza-man Luke delivering a free pizza during LX3.\n- Kerrin Marchese's (literally) one second human rim catch launched by the powerful Jim Butler.\n- Kevin Megill's wicked stomach shot on one Rob Avakian late in the night.\n- Jeff Semienski and Jack Gramlich returning after their debut night, DODGEBALL LX.\nThe moments, the adrenaline, the action, and the excitement of DODGEBALL LX3 will long be remembered by the 29 outstanding competitors in attendance.\nWas it the best non ten-event in history?\nIt may very well have been ...\nDODGEBALL 64 comes at you full speed this coming Saturday night:\nNovember 18th.",
