  "body_text": "2006 has seen the wildest dodgeball events. Weather, players, action, and more have already secured both January and February of this new year into the record books. DODGEBALL 21 started the new year off with an explosive event. From there, everything became unforseen and unpredictable.\n> TWENTY-TWO saw \"Wet War III\", in the eyes of many, the most brutal event in terms of weather.\n> 23 saw the date change three times before it actually occured. T-Shirts were worn for the first time in months as well.\n> XXIV had beautiful weather, but saw fewer players than the two prior events, with not one new player.\n> XXV saw a reverse from XXIV with eleven new players and an overall attendance of 31. \"Wet War IV\" lived up the hype.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ What could all of this mean for DODGEBALL TWENTY-SIX? ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nIt was previously known that the weather wouldn't be all too friendly. An apparent \"snow\" war was nearing. However, upon everyones' arrival at Wall High School, it was quite clear that this would be no \"Snow Ball\" what so ever. Instead, for the second week in a row, and the third time in the last five events, a \"Wet War\" had come.\n\"Wet War V\", obviously much more known as DODGEBALL TWENTY-SIX, saw the biggest drop in attendance probably in history. Participation had reached below 20 with only 14; the second lowest attendance ever behind DAY 1. But don't let the numbers fool you.\nDODGEBALL TWENTY-SIX still delivered no matter how many players were there. Besides the built-up for the event with an awesome poster contest, the action itself turned out to be some of the best ever. There have been many great captains before, but sometimes it takes the right two men to make a night that much better. Arguably the most charismatic competitors ever squared off one-on-one: Steve Adams vs. Kevin Megill.\nThe teams go like this:\nCap. STEVE ADAMS\nDEREK CARTY\nLENNY HERRERA\nALISON BERTSCH\nVALERIE WINSTON\nJUSTIN PIERCE\nTOM ADAMS\nCap. KEVIN MEGILL\nMIKE \"SPUTZ\" KROTT\nKEVIN ADAMS\nLAUREN WINSTON\nSARA DECUIR\nJOHN TRONOLONE\nCHRIS ADAMS\nWhat a confrontation ... What looked to be total domination turned out to be nothing more than a simple victory. Kevin and his \"ice\" warriors were fearless as they defeated the icon Steve Adams and team with a score of 5 to 1 during the first hour and a half of play. Although Steve looked to be down, there was no way he was out. His team scored two more wins, coming closer to a victory. But the victory would not come as the night was called quits at around 9:15.\nKevin Megill: 5\nSteve Adams: 3\nNews and Notes about TWENTY-SIX:\n> Although he did make an appearance before the game began, he did not play. Kevin \"Fitz\" missed his very first event. He debuted at DODGEBALL XTWO and was the only regular from that event. What a run of consecutive events though from the old days at Ocean Road Park (XTWO) to XXV.\n> Diana DiBuccio missed only her second event, with the other being DODGEBALL 20.\n> Dan Spengeman missed his third straight event.\n> John Watters and Kyle Carty missed their second straight event.\n> Just like DODGEBALL XXIV, there was not one new player.\n> One has to give credit to Derek Carty, who is still feeling the effects of the flu.\n> TWENTY-SIX marked the first time Kevin Megill was captain. As for Steve, it was the first since DODGEBALL X.\n> Because of Diana's absence, Justin Pierce now holds the record for the most appearances. The only event he ever missed was DODGEBALL DAY 1. When will his streak end?\n> And if you notice in the attendance chart, DODGEBALL 23 is marked as having 25 players for the evening. When the last attendance chart was released, there was 24. Through research, a numerical mistake had been found. So DODGEBALL 23 did have one more player than previously thought.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nDODGEBALL 27 ... who in the hell knows what is going to happen. How can anyone predict the future especially with the constant changes in players, weather, among other factors. The road to 30 gets more and more interesting ...\nRemember, DODGEBALL 27 is FRIDAY, not Saturday. This has been planned for a while and can be seen at the end of numerous results' pages from the past.\nBe ready on the 17th.",
