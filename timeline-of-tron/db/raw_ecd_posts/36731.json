  "body_text": "The great sport of dodgeball returned to Wall High School for the first time since DODGEBALL 49 on the 22nd of July. On that night, Kevin Adams retained the coveted Captains Championship, a prize many wish to hold. Three weeks later, the very title he vows to keep is up for grabs once again. This was DODGEBALL 51 ...\nHit the Rim ... First\nContinuing off the success of DODGEBALL 50, DODGEBALL 51 witnessed the second elimination-style Rimshot Contest. This time however, there would only be one winner. The prize; the right to face reigning champ, Kevin Adams.\nThe participants for the rimshot contest were Derek Carty, Chris Adams, Valerie Winston, Brent Bitsko, Ryan Letsche, Lauren Winston, Steve Adams, and Kurt Gassner.\nAfter an unsuccessful first round, the second saw consecutive rimshots hit by three legends: Chris Adams, Valerie Winston, and Ryan Letsche. After several attempts, Ryan Letsche became the sole survivor, earning a spot in the main event at DODGEBALL 51.\nRyan Letsche vs. Kevin Adams (Champion)\nIt was a huge match for both competitors to say the least. Kevin, who has won an impressive three-straight times, was going for a record-tying fourth win in a row. Ryan on the other hand was looking to rebound after falling to Joe Kelly back at DODGEBALL 39, who eventually became the winningest captain to date.\nThe first game belonged to Letsche; a quick, action-packed start to DODGEBALL 51. The games went back and forth until midway when Kevin, along with a driven defense of allies, turned the tide that would soon seal Ryan's fate.\nDespite a 5 to 2 loss, every game came down to the wire. The last game of the night oddly enough pitted the captains one-on-one.\nKevin Adams defeated Ryan Letsche to retain the Captains Championship at DODGEBALL 51; 5 - 2.\nPain and Power ... It must be the Gatorade\nOnce a quiet player, Kevin Megill has stepped into the forefront of dodgeball's elite. Having attended over 20 events in succession, the award-winning legend's legacy continued another week. With an array of talents, he may have been the biggest factor in Kevin Adams's victory.\nOne has to respect the amount of heart and determination in challenging captain Ryan Letsche. The game of dodgeball comes so natural to the wily veteran. As usual, dodging and catching came at ease.\nKevin Fitzpatrick didn't win the \"Powerhouse Thrower\" Award for nothing. What an incredible and admirable performance he put on at the inaugural event of Season 6.\n- It was \"do or die\" in one of the first games of the night. Fighting through fatigue, several members of the opposing team, and even the clock left \"Fitz\" no alternative but to come up big with a rimshot. After battling for almost six minutes, the clock was down to a mere 2 seconds when he managed to hit the Letsche-built wooden red target, allowing for a full-team regeneration. The game did continue, but only after the veteran was met with a standing ovation from both his teammates and opponents.\n- Of course, his throwing is what made him a superstar in the first place. Aside from the magnificant rimshot, he consistently pelted his enemies with brute force, most notably on the incomparable Steve Adams.\nSeason 6 First Records ... DODGEBALL 51\n- Attendance: 22\n- New Players: (2) Alex G and Katy G\n- Biggest Return: Rob \"Sharp\" Avakian (Last played at DODGEBALL 49)\n*With the exception of Rob Avakian and the newblood, all other competitors participated at DODGEBALL 50.\n- The world witnessed the second rimshot contest. It was the first time a singles competitor would emerge victorious.\n- Kevin Adams tied two records at DODGEBALL 51: Fourth consecutive captains victory (tied with Joe Kelly) and fourth captains victory overall (also tied with Joe Kelly). His record stands at 4-1.\n- Ryan Letsche's captains record, despite a tremendous showing at 51, falls to 1-2.\n- DODGEBALL 51 was only the second event to use the wooden targets as rims, built by Letsche himself.\n- In a rare occurance, Diana DiBuccio missed DODGEBALL 51.
