  "body_text": "An encounter two years in the making ...\nA comedic, yet competitive clash of champions at dodgeball's 77th extravaganza. Members of the famed Adams and Winston families squared off with one Kathryn Nogueira on the line. Who's heart would be broken?\n\"... The match was a non-rivetting one, with the opposing team absolutely obliterating mine.\"\n- KEVIN MEGILL\nTom Adams came to win and only win. Nothing, not even the double-team tactics of the Winston sisters would stand in his way. His girlfriend, the legendary multi-time award winner Kathryn Nogueira, was his only focus.\nLauren certainly put up one hell of an effort, along with intense allies like Mike Butler, John Tronolone, Sascha Basista, and her own sister Valerie, but there was just no chance. Tom had acquired today's top competitors, and with them, easily annihilated the youngest Winston into oblivian. The ultra-combo of Kevin Fitzpatrick and Chris Adams proved too much as the best of enemies make even better allies.\nIndividually, both Tom and Lauren should be commended for their incredible performances. Tom's accuracy was hot all night while Lauren was consistently the last remaining player for her team. Each of them scored some huge eliminations, but in the end, it was the boyfriend who walked away with the key to Kathryn's heart.\nIt what could have been a very close-fought battle was nothing more than a complete slaughter for the Adams brother. Tom defeated Lauren 11 - 3 at DODGEBALL 77, giving Tom the fourth recorded \"Slaughter Victory\" in history.\nMoments\n: The \"KickCatch\" performed by Mike \"Sputz\" and Diana DiBuccio; the \"CalfCatch\" performed by John Tronolone; the bruising faceshot on Juan Londono.\n________________________________________\n____\n\"DODGEBALL 77 reminded me of the old dodgeball days. It consisted of many laughs, hits (poor Juan's eye), and most importantly fun. It was a good change going back to the original game of dodgeball, without prison ball or using painballs only. The last few weeks have sort of been a 'tester' of doing different variations of the game. I think at 77 it showed that players can still go back and play the game that started over a year ago.\nIn addition, the captain's feud between the two legends of Lauren Winston and Tom Adams made the games more desirable and purposeful.  It's these types of little things that create something on and off the court (i.e. 'winning Kathryn's heart'), and it's great seeing captains who 'want' to win even over something like a person (obviously hypothetical). This truly shows how far dodgeball has come and how many friendships and even relationships have grown from the great game of dodgeball. In the end, this is what matters the most! Thank You!\n- DIANA DIBUCCIO\n\"There were many vicious hits. Juan Londono's was a trademark for sure, both face and crotch. No Prison Ball was good. I like classic.\"\n- KEVIN MEGILL\nRecords of 77\n> Attendance: 17\n> Biggest Return: Dan Turner (Last appearance at DODGEBALL LX3)\n> New Players: 0\n- A rarity in today's dodgeball events, DODGEBALL 77 did not include\nPrison Ball\n.\n- For the second straight week, a \"Slaughter Victory\" was witnessed when Tom Adams crushed Lauren Winston 11 - 3. Tom remains undefeated as a singles captain. Despite the loss, Lauren did manage to tie the record for \"Most Times Captain\" with 7 (along with John Tronolone, Sara DeCuir, and Chris Adams).\n- As an interesting note also concerning the youngest Winston, she was captain exactly 50 events prior headlining DODGEBALL 27 with Lauren Freda.\n- Luke was at it again bringing two free pizzas.\n- Thanks are in order to one Justin Pierce who bought several new painballs to the event.\n- Like LXXVI, DODGEBALL 77 ended around the 11pm mark.\nTOM FUND Week 2\nHere comes the money!
