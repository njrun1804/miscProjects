  "body_text": "\"If there is one thing I learned from the Adams' family growing up is that if you want to stay in the game, you have to give 100% all the time. Being the only girl playing games with them as a kid I had to learn that quick or else I'd sit around being bored. On Saturday I plan to use that same philosophy, go all out or go home, and ironically I'll use it against a member of the very family that taught me that. I respect Kevin as a player, I love having his great abilities behind me, but for 48 I plan on bringing my A game. I'd love to see him win, however I want to win more.\"\n- SARA DECUIR on July 14th, 9:51pm.\nJust from her intensity alone, one had to realize just how important a win would have meant for the legendary Sara DeCuir. A hard throwing female already, along with quick, swift dodges, and several key grabs made her [arguably] the player of the night. It would be a sin not to mention her here on the dodgeball website for a performance like that.\nSteve Adams has always been one the most charismatic players, but even that might be secondary to his resiliency. During one of his many incredible plays of the evening, he somehow managed to catch a ball that impactfully connected with his face. Showing much strength, he continued his winning ways immediately; his reign of terror unceasing.\nSome of the most crafty dodges came from both Kurt Gassner and Dan Turner. Kurt is a long-time veteran, having debuted at DODGEBALL X. Since then, he has always remained as one of the best semi-regulars the game has ever seen with numerous talents. On this night, dodging was perhaps his greatest asset. Dan Turner, another dodgeball general even before his debut at DODGEBALL XXVIII, showcased the same dodging ability. Unless his ball was caught, you rarely saw Dan at the front of the elimination line.\nMike \"Sputz\", known primarily to be a catching machine, used that skill, among others, to almost wipe-out his entire opposing team in one of the games. He became a court leader on his debut and yet some 10 months later, it seems as if he hasn't lost a thing.\nIn a final note from DODGEBALL 48, Tom Adams became the first person to hit the newly created \"rims\", built and designed by Ryan Letsche.\nThe Title Up for Grabs!\nIf the quote above doesn't give you a picture, then the score will. All the hype was well worth it as come gametime, there was nothing to be disappointed about. It was a match some may call \"Mild to Wild\", as the first few games combined took up well over an hour. But further into the night saw the action speed up tremendously; the taste of victory was near ...\nSara DeCuir, who undeniably put on 5-star performance, led her team like a true champion. They secured the first few wins of the night, racking up three midway into the event. But the story took a turn for the worse when her score of three remained while Kevin, backed up by a team primarily of \"old lions\", took the final four wins in succession. The score at midpoint looked like Sara had everything under control. But before one could say \"game over\", the matches got quicker and more intense which saw the downfall of the now-former champion. Kevin Adams has become the new captain's champion and will face John Tronolone next week to see once and for all who goes to DODGEBALL 50 \"carrying\" the gold.\nDODGEBALL 49 Results ... Kevin Adams defeats Sara DeCuir, 5 - 3.\nThe Book gets Bigger\n> Attendance: 24\n*The turnout actually set a new record as it was the sixth time in a row the attendance fell below 30. The previous record was five consecutive events below the 30 mark: (2 runs) DAY 1 to D-DAY 5 and DODGEBALL 35 to DODGEBALL 39.*\n> New Players: (3) Chrissy, Gavin, Jody\n> Biggest Return: Chip Terhune (Last played at DODGEBALL 30)\n> Perhaps without even knowing it, Gavin, at only 3-years-old, set a new record for youngest player. (Interestingly enough, DODGEBALL 48 was Gavin's third birthday). The previous record was also at 3 held by youngster Scotty R. at DODGEBALL 30. Scotty however is several months older.\n> A definite \"thank you\" goes to Ryan Letsche who actually made new \"rims\". Using two pieces of plywood, spray paint, and twine, the new rims were put to the test [obviously succeeding]. This marked the first time that \"human rims\" were not used in the back courts of WHS.\n> Ryan Letsche also purchased two new bulletballs for the event; much appreciation once again.\n> Speaking of the WHS Back courts, the record continued as it was the fifth time in a row that those very courts were used.\n> In a rare occurance, all four of the Adams brothers were on the same team.\n> Kevin Adams's record after his victory at DODGEBALL 48 is at 1-1, having previously lost to older brother Steve at the original \"ten\" event, DODGEBALL X. Sara, despite the loss, still has a decent record of 2-3. She, along with Joe Kelly and Steve Adams, have been captain the most; five times each. At DODGEBALL 49, John Tronolone will also see his fifth time as captain.\n............\nDODGEBALL 49 ... coming soon to WHS ... 7.22.06 ... the final stop before 50.",
