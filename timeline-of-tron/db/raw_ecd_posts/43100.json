All of the comments left on past entries have remained anonymous to this day. I have asked a few peeps already and they too are just as confused as I.\nSo what's the point of this 2-minute rant?\nI am asking for your help.\nIf these supposed athletes want to step onto the court we made famous, then I need back-up. If anyone has any questions or more so concerns, I'll do the best I can to help you. But I cannot gaurantee answers because even I am still asking the questions.\nDODGEBALL 62 is the next event coming to you this Saturday night, November 4th. Then, it's the supposed \"invasion\" from the outside world at DODGEBALL 63. Mark down\nNovember 11th\non your calendars.\nI will post another address real soon.\"\nJOHN TRONOLONE\n12:13am\nOctober 31st, 2006",
