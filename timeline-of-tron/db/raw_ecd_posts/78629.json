No captains were announced, little information distributed or posted, nothing. This 118th melee could perhaps best be summed \"Trial and Error\" - let's just see what happens!\nThe opening contest of the evening was not your standard two-team war, but rather a winner-take-all\nPlayer's Choice Rimshot Contest\n. Warriors had their eye on the prize - the right to form teams any way he/she saw fit. Indeed it was winner-take-all, especially for the loose cannon\nTravis Mills\n, the eventual victor and decision maker for this 23rd\nWet War\n.\n\"Maniac\" Mills would go on to assemble two evenly-matched squads, one named CORBA KI, the other STRIKE FORCE. But judging by the occurrences that had already transpired, it was a safe bet this wouldn't be your traditional two-team encounter, oh no. By the end of eight,\nBoxBall Dodgeball\n,\nPrison Ball\n, and even\nFullCourt Dodgeball\nwould all see action.\nFlash Results by Game\n:\nCobra Ki defeated Strike Force, 6 - 2\nCOBRA KI: 2, 3, 5-P, 6-P, 7-BB, 8-FC\nSTRIKE FORCE: 1, 4\n(\"P\" = Prison Ball, \"BB\" = BoxBall Dodgeball, \"FC\" = FullCourt Dodgeball)\nClearcut winners in this one as the deadly assassins COBRA KI knock off their adversaries 6 to 2. The reintroduction of\nPrison Ball\nand\nBoxBall\nand the newly-created\nFullCourt\nwar served as the Force's downfall.\nMoments & Stars\n: Travis Mills, Kevin Megill, Juan Londono, and Marc Spirito's \"spontaneous humming\"; Bobby Bonney receiving some nasty bodyshots; Diana DiBuccio's game-winning eliminations while sagging; Mike \"Sputz\" Krott and John Tronolone engaging in an event-long rivalry; several players parading around in the oversized Ron Paul sign\nLook What Else You Missed!\nEven before Cobra Ki and Strike Force got it on, combatants went all out in several rare showdowns featuring one game in which players used their opposite throwing arm only to be followed by two rounds of the comedic, though strenuous Dodgeball Battle Royal that ultimately set the stage for the three-hour \"WWE Championship\" brawl.\nRECORDS of 118\n> Attendance: 21\n> Notable Returns: Sara DeCuir (last competed at DB CX3); Marc Spirito (last competed at DB CX3); Bobby Bonney (last competed at DB 114)\n> New Players: (1) Cocoa Driscoll*\n- DODGEBALL 118 was\nWet War XXIII\nand the first Friday event since DODGEBALL 50 in early-August 2006.\n- Travis Mills won the first-ever\nPlayer's Choice Rimshot Contest\n, earning the right to form teams and providing team names (Corba Ki and Strike Force).\n- This was the first event to feature Prison Ball and BoxBall Dodgeball on the same night. Add in another \"first\" with the new FullCourt Dodgeball during Game 8.\n- The supposed \"WWE Title Chase\" allowed combatants to aim for a certain player or \"champion\" all throughout 118. John Tronolone won the Battle Royal and the right to be named the inaugural champ and by the end of 118, \"chase\" winner Mike Edwards ended up carrying the gold.\n- *Cocoa Driscoll is the first dog to ever compete in the game of dodgeball.\nSaturday's DODGEBALL 119\nMegill vs. Wolf\nNo fancy team names or stipulations in this second part of an already grueling Double Header. The ever-powerful, imposing southpaw Kevin Megill. The quick-witted, blocking magician Justin Wolf. Two fierce warriors with absolutely nothing in common except the undying desire to win! What an extraordinary way to cap off 2007!\nThough the bad blood between the two isn't at all prevelent, it was really only a matter of time before these iron men faced off. The icon Megill took Game 1 in this year-end slaughter, barely besting the\nROOKIE of the Year\ncontender.\nNext round, same result.\nGame 3, yet another triumph for the the award-winning left-hander.\nThe nail in the coffin reared its ugly \"head\" in the fourth, Wolf now at a distinct disadvantage. Megill was just one tough customer to deal with and although \"Punter\" Wolf finally managed to get on the board, Megill steam rolled through the competition.\nFlash Results by Game\n:\nKevin Megill defeated Justin Wolf, 5 - 2\nMegill: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7\nWolf: 5, 6\nEach and every round came down to the wire and could have gone either way. The Last Man Standing three-minute clock actually winded down in both Games 1 and 8. In the very end however, it was Team MEGILL that pulled ahead and kept the multi-point advantage. Big ups to both captains who just the night before, competed to the best of their ability.\nMoments & Stars\n: Michael Butler, Chris Daly, and Tom Adams viciously nailed in the groin; the odd smell of propane; Chris Adams and Chris Daly participaing without footwear\nInjury Update\nReturning to action at Saturday's DODGEBALL 119 was the one and only, \"The Big Kat\" Zach Katz. He may be wishing he made other plans because in the early-goings, Katz slipped and fell backwards severely spraining his ankle. As a result, \"The Big Kat\" will be using the assistance of crutches for a few days. It'll only be a matter of time before this wily veteran makes his way back to the Wall High School battlegrounds.\nRECORDS of 119\n> Attendance: 25\n> Notable Returns: Chris Daly (last competed at DB 84); Chris Grasso (last competed at DB 100); Zach Katz (last competed at DB CVII); Steve Adams (last competed at DB CX1)\n> New Players: (2) Christina Rodriguez, Kelly Oberto\n- DODGEBALL 119 was the last event held in the 2007 year.\n- Kevin Megill defeated Justin Wolf, 5 to 2 in the night's main event. Megill moves to 5-1-1 while Wolf stands at 1-1-0.\n.............\nDouble Header History\nThe list of previous multiple event weekends: DAY 1 & DAY 2 (9.3.05 & 9.4.05); XONE & XTWO (11.4.05 & 11.5.05); 18 & 19 (12.16.05 & 12.17.05); XXX4 & 35* (4.7.06 & 4.9.06)\n*Took place on a Friday and Sunday.\nA Real Test of Endurance\nIt takes a great deal of physical stamina and mental strength to partake in any one of the single Saturday brawls. But two straight nights of battering, bruising dodgeball? Only the strong indeed survive.\nHats off to the following competitors who fought tooth and nail for the entire durations of both DODGEBALL 118 and DODGEBALL 119: Bobby Vetrano, Diana DiBuccio, John Tronolone, Juan Londono, Justin Wolf, Kevin Megill, Melissa Kerr, and Mike \"Sputz\" Krott.\nChris Adams, Grant Cornero, Kevin Adams, Mike Edwards, Ryan Letsche, and Tom Adams also showcased their talents throughout the two-day journey.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nArguably the most dominant figures of the last 12 months take their rightful place in the ten event spotlight.\nPLAYER of the Year\ncandidate\nRyan Letsche\nmeets\nROOKIE of the Year\nnominee\nGrant Cornero\nat the one and only DODGEBALL CXX.
