That's November 4th, 2005, better known as DODGEBALL XONE!\nThe 62nd Records\n- Attendance: 5\nThe absolute lowest attendance ever, beating out DODGEBALL 45 which had 10.\n- New Players: 0\n- DODGEBALL 62 did not feature any regular team vs. team games.\n- DODGEBALL 62 did not feature any rims, whether \"Human\" or \"Letsche\".\n- DODGEBALL 62 featured the second ever\nDodgeball Battle Royal\n, created by the one and only Steve Adams. The first battle royal, coined the \"Kevin Megill Memorial\", was held after the main match of DODGEBALL 39.\n- Four of the five players that participated at DODGEBALL 62 also participated at DODGEBALL 45, now the second lowest attendance ever: Kevin Fitzpatrick, Alison Bertsch, Diana DiBuccio, and John Tronolone.\n- For obvious reasons, DODGEBALL 62 had the fewest male players at a single event with 3. The previous record was held at DODGEBALL DAY 1 with 7.\n- DODGEBALL 62 ended roughly 9:30pm, making it one of the shortest events in history.\nThe \"FATAL\" ATTRACTION!\nAn interesting change to the game these battle royals add. Rather than depending on teammates, your eyes, ears, and endurance are your closest allies. Without those, one becomes a sitting duck, ready to be destroyed by a single throw.\n- You have\nJim Martin\n, the light and agile dodger whose quickness certainly game him an edge.\n- Next is\nJohn Tronolone\n, a man who has seen and done all in the game of dodgball. His experience was the key to his success.\n- The fearless\nAlison Bertsch\nwould use her strength and deflections as her part of her strategy.\n- Powerhouse monster\nKevin Fitzpatrick\nwas a sure odds-on favorite to win; brute force, swift dodges, among many of his other talents.\n- Rounding out the five would be veteran\nDiana DiBuccio\n, with the use of her hands would be her biggest asset.\nThe legendary John Tronolone started off as only he would have liked, securing the first two games of the first-ever Fatal Five-Way Elimination match-up. But his first victories were short lived as nemesis Kevin Fitzpatrick won the third and fourth games, tying it up with Tronolone. The next game however would favor John once again, taking the fifth battle royal game and improving his score to 3. But \"Fitz\" was no where near finished with his rival. He'd pick up his third win also taking game 6. Would the final battle prove one man's superiority?\nIn the final game of DODGEBALL 62, neither John nor Fitz would walk away victorious. Prodigy Jim Martin woud instead take home the gold, coming out the final winner of the 62nd dodgeball spectacular.\nSimplified Version of the Battle Royal\nGame 1: John wins\nGame 2: John wins\nGame 3: \"Fitz\" wins\nGame 4: \"Fitz wins\nGame 5: John wins\nGame 6: \"Fitz\" wins\nGame 7: Jim wins\nJohn Tronolone and Kevin Fitzpatrick tied in the Fatal Five-Way Dodgeball Battle Royal at DODGEBALL 62, both earning 3 victories. Jim Martin placed runner-up with 1 win. Neither Alison nor Diana earned a victory.\nDODGEBALL LX3: WAR\nHow odd that DODGEBALL 62 was billed as \"The Calm before the Storm\". It appears as if that may have been true. But now it's on to serious business as dodgeball is set to be invaded come this Saturday night, November the 11th.\nIt is no secret that for weeks, even months, the dodgeball website and more-so dodgeball's own, has been verbally attacked by a bunch of unknowns. The one question perhaps on everyones' mind is\nWho can it be?\nIt appears as if the answer to that will remain a mystery, at least until LX3.\nAny developments to this story will be posted as soon as possible. Those that plan on attending, it is urged that you frequently check the dodgeball website, here at dodgeball.livejournal.com.",
