From the days of the foam footballs under the Ocean Road Park lights, to the bulletball wars of the famed Wall High School tennis courts, he has literally seen and basically done all in this great sport. But despite the history, he has never once held the coveted captain's crown, the very prize he looks to possess in just days time. His record as captain in the days of old itself is quite poor, having lost three consecutive times [Chris Adams at 9, Jim Martin at 20, and Kevin Megill at 30]. His first, and to this day, only win came at DODGEBALL 35 against one of his biggest rivals, Kevin Fitzpatrick. With his fifth go as team general this weekend, you can bet your ass he will do whatever he must to become\nthe\nman.

Gunning for whom he feels are the \"top dogs\", he has proven time and again that he himself is one of those very elite players. To this day, he is the only \"Act of Courage\" award winner, an accolade he earned the hard way. Many can still remember the days of the dreaded cast in which he used to play in. Despite the injury, he somehow managed to stay at the top of his game. And now at 100%, the future just couldn't look any brighter.\nMuch like his challenging opponent, he has seen luck turn sour with a loss as team general in his very first try.

Be there on Saturday, the 22nd and catch all the great action starting at 6:30.\nThis is the last event before literally the biggest one of them all, DODGEBALL 50.
