  "body_text": "Welcome to the new home of Dodgeball.\nHere you will find every single bit of news concerning this awesome sport, and more. From player profiles and promotional posters, to firey feuds and detailed event results, the new home of the greatest sport alive is finally ready to be launched.\nIf you think about dodgeball practically every day, then this is the place for you. The official Dodgeball website has officially arrived into your homes via a computer screen.\nSo why not get started with the first bit of news, that being the awesome DODGEBALL 9 and its results.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n>>> DODGEBALL 9 <<<\nSimiliar to that of DODGEBALL VII, the weather was not all too friendly. To start, it seemed a bit colder than VII, even though not raining as hard or as much for that matter. But the weather does not stop these iron men, and women obviously, from playing a game they all love so much. DODGEBALL 9 is already being compared to VII, and some would agree that it was better for several reasons. Eighteen veterans joined by one new comer made for an unforgetable event.\nOn a night where Chris Adams and KJohn Tronolone were captains, you can guarantee all hell to break loose.\n- The competition was heated on October 22nd, 2005, as feuds were re-newed ...\nTom Adams and KJohn Tronolone certainly escalated their rivalry with some hard shots this past weekend. Who will forget the unbelievable 'nut' shot suffered at the hands of KJohn. Tom was apparently not paying attention to his enemy, giving John an opening to just annihilate his opponent, and annihilate he did. A clean shot to the 'balls' if you will that sent the third eldest Adams to the ground and eventually out of action for several minutes. But Tom came back with a vengeance, eliminating several of the opposing team members in just minutes time and scoring the game winner. The icing on the cake during that string of eliminations came when Tom scored his first ever elimination on \"the Creation\" himself.\nThe Pierce/DiBuccio rivalry is history in the making. Constant trash talking, as both are filled with hatred. Justin certainly did a number on Diana at \"9\", a day that Diana will most likely never forget. Diana, as always though, will have another day. Can she finally settle the score with her arch-nemesis? Time will only tell.\nA feud that would be very interesting to see in the near future would be Steve Adams vs. Kevin Adams. These two might be siblings, but come dodgeball, you can bet that there won't be any brotherly-love.\n- Certain moments and individuals stood out as well...\nBen is a great new rookie to the game. He could easily become one of the best, if he isn't already.\nPrior to the game starting, KJohn chose his rival-captain's girlfriend Lauren F. This was the first time Chris and Lauren have been on opposing sides. An evil move by \"the King\" to say the least.\nSpeaking of Lauren, she could very well be the best female dodgeball player, and she shows why week after week. A testiment to her as she got several big eliminations at \"9\", as well as remaining in numerous games for long periods of time.\nKevin Adams certainly takes after his brothers. In a very rare occurance, he caught two of KJohn's rocket-launched balls in the same game. Props are deserved to this young prodigy.\nDan \"Quick Sand\" Spengeman probably threw better last night than he ever has. He was rifling balls left and right, with eliminations racking up. Combine those stats with his dodging ability, and you have a legend in the making.\nIn some of the more smooth performances in dodgeball history, KJohn used the rain to his advantage when he purposely slid to the ground, ducking a rocket from Justin Pierce. KJohn got back up to a nice applause from his peers. He also had some impressive high-jump dodges as well.\nValerie once again stepped up her game at \"9\". She has improved with each passing week, trying her best to help her team. Along with a few eliminations, she hit two life-saving 'rims' to her credit.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n>>> DODGEBALL X: The Preview <<<\n*** Official DODGEBALL X theme song: Staind \"Mudshovel\" ***\nDODGEBALL X will be an epic night, filled with more than just dodgeball action.\nFor the first time ever, \"Dodgeball Excellence\" awards will be given to top players for various skills and talents. Approximately 10 awards will be given out during this time.\nOn top of that, The Dodgeball Hall of Fame 'ceremony' will also be taking place. Four male inductees and two female inductees have already been chosen by the 'Vince McMahon' of dodgeball, KJohn himself. Those six incredible athletes deserve every bit of credit going into \"X\" and what better way to show them then to include them in such an elite group, the HOF. The start time of DODGEBALL X is 6pm, so please try and get there as early as possible. As for the inductees, you will pretty much have to arrive at 6pm in order to receive your award.\nSo the big question that many are asking is \"Who are these inductees anyway?\"\nThe six inductees into the Hall of Fame are:\nDIANA DIBUCCIO\nLAUREN FREDA\nCHRIS ADAMS\nJUSTIN PIERCE\nMICHAEL ROSINSKI\nDAN SPENGEMAN\nAll of you have proved why you are the most feared and easily recognized players on and even off the court.\nFor those not being inducted, dodgeball is not ending by any means. Bring all that you have onto the court and destiny will take care of the rest.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nIt was a night where Chris Adams and company defeated KJohn and company with a final score of 6 to 3.\nDODGEBALL 9 will leave all with memories, thus leading into the biggest dodgeball event in history.\nDODGEBALL X is this Friday, October 28th, with special start time of 6pm.\nAlso, be sure to check out the website daily as news could pop up at any time. Emails will also be sent for updates.\nAnd as per the final part of this historic homecoming, \"The Creation\" John Tronolone has a few words:\n\"I thank each and every one of you who have participated in this awesome sport. I certainly would have never guessed dodgeball becoming what it is today. Through 9 events, dodgeball has generated over 60 players, produced some fun and intense rivalries, and the most important thing to me, provided me with long-lasting friendships. It truly has been a run, a run that I would certainly hate to see end. I couldn't be more ready for DODGEBALL X as it will truly be a memorable night for everyone.\"",
