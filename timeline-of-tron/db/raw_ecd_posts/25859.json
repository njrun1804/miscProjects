His dedication and well-known fact that he has brought many of his outside friends, and relatives, into the circle of dodgeball are all key factors in the success of the game itself.

It is highly unlikely the same will happen for DODGEBALL XXX-SEVEN, mainly in part to weather reports claiming beautiful weather.\nTag Team Warfare\nCaptains battles have become more and more interesting in recent weeks, especially among John Tronolone. The idea of Tag-Team Captains Matches has been a taboo idea for some time. While the games might not see much of a change, a fun new way of choosing teams may come about.\nThe first rumored tag team battle, if of course all participants agree [and attend], would be between the \"Allied Powers\" Award winners:\nSteve Adams and Travis Mills\nvs.\nLauren Freda and Valerie Winston\nWhat will become of this possible tag team captains match?\nAll the questions will be answered come this Friday, April 28th. The final April 2006 event takes place at Wall High School, with start time of 6:30.\n----------------------------------------\nMay Schedule\nThe following is a schedule of events for the upcoming month:\nSaturday, May 6th ~ DODGEBALL 38\nSaturday, May 13th ~ DODGEBALL 39\nSaturday, May 20th ~ DODGEBALL 40\nSaturday, May 27th ~ DODGEBALL 41\nAs of the moment, no events have a scheduled venue. Those will be decided in the upcoming weeks. Start time for all events, unless specified, is 6:30.\nAlso, if you have birthday coming up and do NOT want to play dodgeball on it [or miss an event because of it], the schedule can always be altered.\nPoster Contest\nThere will be a poster contest in the month of June, most likely for DODGEBALL 42. An official date has yet to be determined, but it is a good time to jot some ideas down. Everyone, even non-players, are eligible to enter.",
