  "body_text": "\"... If a game can spark this much popularity in just 2 days, what exactly can that say about the future? In all hopes, dodgeball will become THE new thing to do on the weekends ...\"\n- JOHN TRONOLONE on September 9th, 2005.\nThe future looked pretty damn good that's for sure!\nOver 190 players have turned what was a small 12-person gathering into a year of faceshots, nutshots, spills, falls, laughs, captains feuds, and most importantly, memories and friendships. Dodgeball has gone one full year, uninterrupted! Fifty-four mind-blowing, action-packed events have turned the weekends into more than just \"hanging-out\".\nThe 54th installment celebrated all the good times, and the bad, that players have experienced along the way. Foam footballs, painballs, bulletballs, rimshots, and more brought back those feelings of nostalgia for many.\nThe One Year Anniversary event, DODGEBALL 54, looked something like this:\nPart I: OCEAN ROAD PARK\nYou want to talk about unpredictability, look no further than the first portion of DODGEBALL 54.\nUpon arriving at the courts, legend John Watters informed his peers of a poweroutage in the surrounding area thanks to Hurricane Ernesto. What this meant is that upon dusk, the lights would not be shine down on ORP. But don't think for one second an event of this magnitude was going to come to a screaching halt ...\n> One of the key ingredients in dodgeball's success was the actual playing grounds. Located on the border of Sea Girt and Spring Lake, Ocean Road Park was the birthplace of such a game. The first 15 events emanated from the park, sparking the initial popularity that has allowed for dodgeball to reach its first birthday. It was only fitting that the OYA take place here.\n> The foam footballs made what some considered to be a long-awaited return. The harmless weapons that shaped the sport came \"out of retirement\" so-to speak. Joined with the pink Rozzball and the original weapons of mass destruction, the dreaded painballs, the first two hours of DODGEBALL 54 were completely insane.\nEXTRAS!\nNow it was rumored that a waterballoon fight was planned. However, that turned out to be untrue. But Justin Pierce and Mike \"Sputz\" had secretly formulated their own plan in making the best of DODGEBALL 54.\nAfter the second game, Pierce and \"Sputz\" ran around the courts spraying their unsuspecting peers with water! Buying two of the largest waterguns they could find, they created much laughter for everyone in attendance. Much like the waterballoon fight at DODGEBALL 50, it will easily be remembered as one of the most choatic few minutes in dodgeball history.\nTHE INTERMISSION\nAs it was understood from the very start, Ocean Road Park would not be hosting DODGEBALL 54 entirely. With each passing second, it was obvious visibility was getting worse. At around 7:30pm, it was agreed that the action move to what many consider to be the primary home of dodgeball, the famed Wall High School tennis courts.\nBut upon arriving, a mass of tennis players had already occupied the courts, stopping DODGEBALL 54 for the time being. It was also learned from John Tronolone that at exactly 7:53pm, the Ocean Road Park lights miraculously came on! It was during this short intermission that a majority were willing to wait patiently in hopes to grab any tennis courts to empty. As luck would have it, play resumed no more than 15 minutes later as the WHS back courts were available for use.\nEXTRAS!\nTime went by quickly thanks in part to award-winning player Alison Bertsch. As players waited for the to courts to clear, they enjoyed a delicious cake before the start of Part II. On the cake read \"Dodgeball One Year\".\nPart II: WALL HIGH SCHOOL\n> From the good old days of Ocean Road Park came the present-day atmosphere of Wall High School. Through most of the winter and a good portion of the spring and summer events, WHS has become the more popular of the two \"homes\" in dodgeball's run. The last three hours of the OYA added much competition to an already unforgettable night.\n> The foam footballs were pushed aside and the bulletballs were welcomed with open arms! One could easily tell the games saw more strategic plays, rather than suicidal ones. The very weapons that have broken three fingers and given players bloody noses have never been taken lightly as they have and always will hurt like hell.\nEXTRAS!\nUnlike the ORP portion of DODGEBALL 54, WHS was greeted with great tunes provided by Alison Bertsch's iPod, with assisstance from Diana DiBuccio's radio. The second half of an already memorable event went out with a bang!\nSadly, there was a severe injury at DODGEBALL 54. Diana DiBuccio debuted at the inaugural event last September and little would she have expected that one year later she would suffer the same injury three others have endured; a broken pinky finger. As of mid-day September 4th, her right pinky finger is broken in three places and may very well require some sort of surgical procedure to repair such damage. On behalf of everyone involved with dodgeball, she is wished a very speedy recovery.\n~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~\nTHE MATCH\n--> Valerie Winston vs. Lauren Winston <--\nOne of the few things that remained consistent throughout the OYA was the captains match itself.\nIt was perhaps the biggest return match in all of dodgeball! The sisters Winston faced off at the original event and some one year later, they were at it again! At DODGEBALL DAY 1, Valerie defeated her younger sibling 3 to 1. The stakes were high for this one as Lauren was looking to avenge her loss from 2005.\nThe foam footballs easily added unpredictability. Perhaps by more luck than anything, Valerie's team prevailed in the first three games of the \"Winston Cup\" as Lauren went winless. Would Lauren make a comeback or was it too late?\nAs the action spilled onto Wall High School, Lauren managed to pick up two wins before event's end. However, Valerie's sizable lead from ORP and her much earned victories at WHS  pulled her ahead greatly, defeating her little sis in the rematch from DAY 1, 7 games to 2.\nDODGEBALL 54: Valerie Winston defeated Lauren Winston ... 7 - 2.\n~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~\nTHE RECORDS\n> Attendance: 31\n> New Players: (1) Doug [played at ORP portion of the event]\n> Biggest Returns: Robert Brown and Lindsay Gough (both last played at DODGEBALL 35)\n> DODGEBALL 54 was the first event to be played at both Ocean Road Park and Wall High School.\n> Obviously due to both venues being used, DODGEBALL 54 was the first event to include both human rims and the actual basketball rims as forms of team regeneration.\n> Valerie Winston was captain for the first time since DODGEBALL 8. Lauren Winston's last run came in Season 3 at DODGEBALL 27. Interestingly enough, both sisters's previous opponent before DODGEBALL 54 was Lauren Freda.\n>\nValerie Winston vs. Lauren Winston\nis one of three return matches, as\nDiana DiBuccio vs. Alison Bertsch\nheadlined DODGEBALL TWENTY-TWO & DODGEBALL 23, and\nKevin Adams vs. Ryan Letsche\nheadlined DODGEBALL 51 & DODGEBALL FIFTY-TWO.\n> Diana DiBuccio became only the fourth player, the first woman, to suffer a broken finger. She joins the unlucky list along with Chris Burke, Dan Spengeman, and Mike \"Sputz\".\n> Along with waterguns, Justin Pierce bought several new bulletballs, including three smaller sized ones. Mike \"Sputz\" as well brought a very popular Vortex football.\n> Chris Adams was the only player to not sign the sign-in sheet.\n~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~\nTHE MEMORIES\nThis is a small compilation of the occurances at DODGEBALL 54. Many will surely remember:\n- How few players could actually aim with the foam footballs.\n- Dan Spengeman and Sara DeCuir on the roof of the ORP bathrooms filming.\n- Mike \"Sputz\" and Justin Pierce running after players, spraying them with water.\n- The adorable combo of Alexandra and Scotty Ratcliffe fighting off their much larger opponents.\n- Steve Adams purposely falling face-first onto his brother Chris's carhood during \"intermission\".\n- The cake in which Alison Bertsch brought to celebrate such an event.\n- Dan Spengeman wanting to capture video footage of players single-filing into the tennis courts.\n- John Tronolone's vicious bulletball shots on Steve Adams and Zach Katz.\n- Mike \"Rozz\" serving as the largest \"human\" rim in the game's history.\n~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~ - ~\nTHE END\nWhen an event of this caliber comes to an end, one can only wonder what will happen next. All that is known is the memory of DODGEBALL 54 will never be forgotten as it turned out to be the most unpredictable and certainly unorthodox event ever.\nA special \"Thank You\" go Mike \"Sputz\", Diana DiBuccio, Justin Pierce, and Alison Bertsch for their added contributions!\nThank you to EVERYONE who made dodgeball what it is today.\n... One Year Later ...",
