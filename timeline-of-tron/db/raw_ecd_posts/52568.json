  "body_text": "\"We started out with only a few players, but before long we had some hard fought Prison Ball games. Granted we lost nearly all of them and I got a tremendous nutshot from my dodgeball rival Kevin Fitzpatrick, but it was still a great event for all involved.\"\n- MIKE EDWARDS\nThe Never-ending Rivalry ...\nWill the madness ever end?\nIt was just last week where arguably the biggest return match was scheduled to occur; Kevin Fitzpatrick looked to make it 2 and O against rival Chris Adams. But in an interesting turn of events, a conflicting work schedule prevented \"Fitz\" from proving that he is the better man. The rematch the world waited to see was put on hold.\nInstead of the hyped match between the two, a returning Lenny Herrera stepped up to the plate and challenged the eldest Adams brother. But the young catching machine struck out as the powerhouse Adams easily silenced the prodigy.\nHeading into LXXVI, one just knew \"Fitz\" was looking to duplicate the success of his arch nemisis. With \"Fitz\" named one of the captains at LXXVI, would anyone step up?\n-- Can you say\nUnSTOPAble\n?\n>> Kevin Fitzpatrick vs. Lauren Stopa\nLooking back at the history of captains competition, there have been only two matches that can be considered as \"Slaughter Victory\":\nI.\n: Kyle Carty's win over Steve Adams at DODGEBALL XXX-SEVEN is the first recorded victory of this kind. The end result was an astounding 14 for Kyle compared to Steve's 2.\nII.\n: December 2006's DODGEBALL LX SEVEN witnessed the trio known as \"KKK\" (K. Adams, K. Marchese, K. Megill) annihilate their opposition 13 - 3.\nThe multi-time award winning powerhouse sent a message loud and clear. He came to win and nothing would stand in his way.\nFirst-half summary:\nGame 1: \"Fitz\" wins\nGame 2: \"Fitz\" wins\nGame 3: \"Fitz\" wins\nGame 4: \"Fitz\" wins\nGame 5: \"Fitz\" wins\nGame 6: \"Fitz\" wins\nGame 7: \"Fitz\" wins ...\n... The tide shifted briefly for Stopa, picking up the victory in Game 8. But before long, the slaughter extended into the late night hours with \"Fitz\" unopposed by his opposition. The tally by the end of the night read an astonishing 11 for Kevin.\nA gutsy performance put forth by Lauren Stopa who not once showed any signs of fatigue or quit. Brothers Mike and Pat Langley also got a taste for the bulletballs, putting on galant effort in the first attempt with the dreaded weapons. The overall longevity of Mike Edwards in many of the games is also worth noting.\nSo what could have caused the complete downfall of Team STOPA? It wasn't so much a collapse rather than a tremendous outing by Kevin and Tom Adams as well as \"Fitz\" himself. And get this, Chris was actually chosen as Fitzpatrick's first ally!\nYou just gotta love this game.\nKevin Fitzpatrick defeated Lauren Stopa, 11 - 1.\n\"The prolific return of the bulletballs often quickened the games and led to more defensive play as they were not easily seen in the dark. However, after playing two games with and two games without bulletballs, it was clear that players wanted the daring, quick paced games that only bulletballs can provide.\"\n- MIKE EDWARDS\nLXXVI Stats\n> Attendance: 19\n> Biggest Return: Dan Coran (Last appearance at DODGEBALL LVII)\n> New Players: (1) Pat Langley\n- DODGEBALL LXXVI was\nWet War XIV\n: the first\nSnow War\n.\n- DODGEBALL LXXVI featured the dreaded bulletballs for the first time since DODGEBALL 73 nearly a month ago. There were a few painball-only games early on, but were canceled midway. The entire event was played under\nPrison Ball\nRules, ending at 10:52pm.\n- Kevin Fitzpatrick's defeat of Lauren Stopa is only the third officially recorded \"Slaughter Victory\" in history. Lauren remains winless in two captains attempts while Fitz moves to 3-1-0.\n- Oddly enough, Luke was no where to be found at LXXVI. The TOM FUND however did collect some nice donations.\n- Steve Adams's highly promoted surprise remains a secret as he was absent from LXXVI.\n- And in a final note from DODGEBALL LXXVI, last week's debuting star Mike Langley brought along his identical twin brother Pat. According to statistics, this is the first time twins have partaken in a dodgeball event.\nTOM FUND Week 1!\nThanks to everyone who contributed to this worthy cause. The official count stands at just over\n$22\n! A phenomenal start!\nDODGEBALL 77\nWill the rivalry between \"Fitz\" and Adams cease? What could Steve Adams possibly have up his sleeve? Can the dodgeball community except yet another snowy showdown? What new number will the TOM FUND reach? All this and more at dodgeball's 77th spectacular.\n--> Just wait until you hear about the forthcoming captains confrontation.\n--> The last event of the month!\nFebruary 24\n!",
