Welcome to January 7th, 2006 ...\nAt DODGEBALL VII on October 8th, 2005, two females would be captains; Valerie Winston and Lauren Freda. The next week, they squared off again to settle their \"leaders\" feud once and for all. That night, Lauren Freda defeated her now HOF rival. At DODGEBALL 21, two more females would share that very spotlight. The first captain is the sister of HOFer Valerie Winston, Lauren. Lauren's opponent is the girlfriend of \"The Creation\", Liz Nogueira. It would certainly be a very interesting match-up for the mere fact that neither Lauren nor Liz play that often. But the players they selected made up two impressive squads.\nIt was a seesaw match-up right up until the end. The score was tied at 4 apeice going into the final, decisive game. Liz certainly caused her share of damage during the night with one explosive [and controversial] game winner on opposing team member Dan Spengeman. Liz wanted victory ... But, it would be Lauren Winston and her mammoth team being the victors of DODGEBALL 21, picking up their 5th win.\n..........\nTOP PLAYERS of DODGEBALL 21:\n> Unquestionably, Mike \"Sputz\" Krott put on one hell of a performance. His throwing was very impressive, whether he was sneaking around at the sidelines or standing right in front of you. His throwing, as good as it was, was actually only second to his catching. Mike probably caught more than anyone else has in a single night of play. Within the first minutes of game play, he had already caught 5.\n> Dan Spengeman certainly lived up to his HOF name. He could have eliminated the most enemies throughout the night in regards to his throwing. He also hit two \"rims\", or \"cans\", which is a very difficult feat.\n> He had not been seen since DODGEBALL XTWO, but that did not affect his game. He was a late entrant at DODGEBALL 21, but Darien Brown was easily a key player. He caught well and his throws were accurate; enough said.\n> The Carty brothers proved that you don't have to be the one of the oldest players to be the best. Kyle and Derek, who debuted at DAY 1 and D-DAY 6 respectively, were both standout players at 21. Intensity reeks of the Brothers Carty!\n> After the first time, most think it's just luck. After the second time, one would hopefully change the gameplan. What does this all mean? ... If you want to get a sexchange the cheap, yet painful way, ask Tom Adams ... For the second week in a row, Tom was on the receiving end of a violent \"nut\"shot. The accomplice, also for the second week in row, was Mike \"Sputz\". This is the third time Tom has felt \"real\" pain of a \"bullet\" ball in his dodgeball career. Not surprisingly, he had to be carried off the court. As for \"Sputz\", he appears to be on a roll. Now the question remains: Can Tom and \"Sputz\" make it three weeks in a row?\n> Honorable mentions go to Alison Bertsch and Kevin Adams. Alison maybe the hardest throwing female ever. Kevin, injured arm and all, still played as if nothing was physically wrong. He caught many times during the evening.\n..........\nThrough the first twenty dodgeball events, the average attendance is 26.9, which is an impressive number, especially this time of the year. DODGEBALL 21 had a nice 30, with three new players: Jack Mess, Matt Kersus, and Chip Terhune. The total number of dodgeball participants is now at 99 ...\n2006 is off and running, and there is no turning back. The date is set for the next big extravaganza: January 14th, 2006 ... It's DODGEBALL 22!",
