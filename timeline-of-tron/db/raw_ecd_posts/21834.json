The combination of decorations, music, awards, and the overall attendance [including spectators] made DODGEBALL 20 everything I hoped it would be, and more.

Heaven on earth.\n...\nJust a few days ago, Dan [Spengeman] was telling the story of his first day at dodgeball, DODGEBALL DAY 3, and what he thought upon on arrival as well as his reaction after the night concluded. It's better coming from him so I'll save that part. But what he did for me was bring back the memories of the very first dodgeball events.\nI think the foam footballs are what make me laugh the most. To put it bluntly, the equipment was shitty. I think it's nice that we have evolved if you will. But back then, footballs with \"chunks\" (as Steve put it a few weeks ago) were our weapons. I don't know how, but they worked. Half of the time, they wouldn't go in the direction you wanted them to go in, making for laughs many a time.\nMost veterans, mainly those on the \"Most Events Played\" list, remember the turnouts to be much smaller than at the present time. As the weeks progressed, dodgeball clearly became bigger and bigger, adding the likes of some of my favorite opponents (and teammates) like the dedicated and highly athletic Derek Carty, the catching machine Lenny Herrera, among others. Those two are prime examples as well that this game can be for all ages, seeing how they are two of the 'youngins' on the court. Add in other young stars like John Watters and Kevin Adams and dodgeball wouldn't be the same.\n...\nAt times, I felt dodgeball was becoming too serious. What I mean by that is the \"fun\" factor was leaking out and the competitive edge among everyone was at an all-time high. Don't get me wrong, for myself personally, the \"fun\" is still ALL there. But for others, it might have gone away. Do I feel I get a lot of \"heat\"? Absolutely. But that will never cloud my judgment as to why I play. I think DODGEBALL 30 will bring back that feeling of nostalgia for many players ... that this is just a game. But a game where friends are made and for me, lives are changed forever.\nI don\u2019t know what else to say, seeing how said everything I felt needed to be said in my DODGEBALL 20 'address'. All that is left is that damn corny, but truthful phrase of THANK YOU. Six incredible months have gone by and we are still going strong. I don't know about you, but I'm no where near ready to quit.\"\nJOHN TRONOLONE\n1:09AM\nMarch 12th, 2006",
