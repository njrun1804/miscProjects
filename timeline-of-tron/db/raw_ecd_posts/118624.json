And since that Labor Day Weekend in 2005, the game's most enduring rivalry has remained unfinished.\nWith our final events on the horizon, the ongoing series of battles between sisters\nValerie and Lauren\nhas to end\nnow\n. They're deadlocked at 2-2-2, an uncanny conclusion - or lack there of. There's no way around it this time; it must see finality and at the 199th, it will.\nThe Story Behind This Story\nPrior to that fateful September evening, let it be known that the initial idea behind the journey we call\nECD\nbegan with the help of the Winston duo. I remember it well, too.\nFins restaurant was the place some odd months before the inaugural \"DODGEBALL DAY 1\". My mind, well, a race full of ideas and the ladies that sat across tried to keep pace. It was during this that I expressed great interest in the creation of a dodgeball league. We jotted some names thinking nothing of it.\nScroll to the 3rd of September at the coveted Ocean Road Park basketball courts and magically my paper dream became the ultimate reality. That night,\nECD\n's family feud commenced with Valerie and Lauren sharing the spotlight. While the elder Winston captured the victory, the subsequent seven-plus years of competition never ceased.\nOne More Time\nThis is no ordinary encounter as two crucial stipulations have been added in an effort to settle this once and for all:\n\u25ac They've competed in singles contests, 2-vs-2 matches, and even a 6-person war. This time, while a fitting one-on-one showdown,\nPick Your Poison\nrules will be in effect for the selection of teams. For those unaware, V & L will choose each others' supporting squads.\n\u25ac Additionally, I have designated one particular player to participate as a member of both teams. This pre-selected combatant will also cement their legacy as the unprecedented\n15th Inductee of the ECDElite Hall of Fame\n.\nWhat's Left?\nYour attendance is all that remains.
