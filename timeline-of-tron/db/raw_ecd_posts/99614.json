  "body_text": "TRONOLONE vs. LETSCHE in S17 MidSeason Showdown:\nThe Stakes Never Higher!\nPerhaps no confrontation over the last 11 months had produced such raw emotion and physical intensity the likes of which felt and experienced at this career-jeopardizing war. Self-professed \"Creation\"\nJohn Tronolone's\npassion, desire, and most importantly captaincy were put to the test while rivaling general -\n*wink-wink*\nbest buddy\nRyan Letsche\n- attempted to save face both literally and figuratively. The six-week war of words had finally ceased; put up or shut up for this pair of dodgeball superpowers!\nBoth leading captains immediately took the fight to each other in the opening contest. Their supporting players, a slew of established heavyhitters, could easily sense the sick violence this collision was sure to entail. By the end of the first round, Letsche was one-up on his rival captain. Tronolone's initial downfall would only continue too, putting further pressure on he and his closest allies. The \"Rimshot King\" had advanced to 2 and 0.\nThen the boxing gloves were ripped off.\nThe match-altering third proved to be the pivotal turning point. Tronolone refused to lie in the grave alive and was able to mount a solid counterstrike against his supposed \"brother from another mother\". The quick-witted, sideline specialties from DiBuccio coupled with the dynamite tandem \"Punter\" Wolf and Kevin Fitzpatrick's impactful power maneuvers catapulted the \"Creation\" ahead 3 to 2. The forthcoming \"sadistic sixth\" would make or break Letsche.\nBy this point, the two-hour war shifted over to the dark and grim front battlegrounds, but it was the inclusion of Prison Ball that nearly-atomic bombed Tronolone into near surrender. The cannons from southpaw Megill, fierce attacks from Teitelbaum, and the merciless chopping-down of enemies by \"The Axe\" Adams may have forced the \"Creation\" to raise the white flag had the beatings persisted. Something, or someone, had to give in the finale.\nThe raging fire within despite such physical and mental anguish had yet to die down. After an inconclusive six brutal battles, the veteran chiefs acknowledged that they and they\nalone\nwould have to settle this damn thing mano-e-mano. With weapons stockers positioned and the combatants themselves equipped, it was go time.\nThe seesaw one-on-one climax electrified spectators each eager to witness first-hand their heroic general come out victorious. The single, fatal blow came in attempt to rearm and reload, with both adversaries' backs turned. But it was Tronolone who jumped through the window of opportunity first, rifling his last instrument of destruction into his unsuspecting nemesis's right leg. \"The Creation\" collapsed to the ground in a sigh of relief knowing that in that one second he had prevented his legacy from permanent termination.\nFlash Results by Game\nLetsche: 1, 2, 6\nTronolone: 3, 4, 5, 7*\nBattle Royal champions. Rimshot Contest victors. Multi-time Season Finale headliners. Two of the all-time greats and a pair of lifelong buddies putting it all on the line for the world to see. What a match.\nAnd for one John Tronolone, an end result like this tasted ever-so sweet!\nThe Rules\n: Classic two-team match-up with standard rules in Games 1 to 5, Prison Ball in Game 6, and the one-on-one tiebreaker* in Round 7.\nThe Match\n: John Tronolone defeated Ryan Letsche, 3(1) - 3, in a double stipulation\nWhite Flag-CREAMation\nmatch. The victory prevented Tronolone from captaincy retirement.
