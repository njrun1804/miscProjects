  "title": ">>> The EVOLUTION OF DODGEBALL",
  "date": "",
  "body_text": "\"I can still remember that September afternoon at Ocean Road Park. The weather was perfect, and I wanted to do something outdoors, as did the rest of us. When I brought up dodgeball, even though there were only 7 of us, it somehow worked. We played for about 2 hours. The day though would soon turn to night. But before leaving the park for the evening, I noticed three kids playing their own game. That's when I made mention of a 10-person dodgeball game. This was the first time I ever met John Watters, Christian Ndreko, and Kyle Carty; three names now infamous with the sport. They played for a few good hours with us, a night I am sure none will forget.\nThe next morning, the physical pain all of us felt was shockingly quite bad (lol). I guess I didn't realize how draining dodgeball can be. But the amount of fun the previous night had given made me hungry for more. I called up Diana first, asking if she'd play again despite the physical pain. She, along with the likes of Mike Rozz and the Winston Sisters, were up for the challenge once again. But I knew I had to get more people involved. That's when a man by the name of Steve Adams comes into this very large picture. I called him first and he accepted, along with other friends of his; Justin Pierce and Justin Godynick. Travis Mills and Kristin Driscoll came to play as well as did my angelic girlfriend of over one year, Liz Nogueira. I made a few more calls and before long, the sun went down and the lights at Ocean Road Park were lit for DODGEBALL DAY 2 on September 4th. Who would have thought that crappy little nerf footballs would make for three hours of fun?\nI will never forget what Steve said during the final few minutes of DAY 2: 'John, you are genuis for putting this together' (or something like that). The word genuis sticks out the most (lol). DAY 2 for me solidified dodgeball as a weekly event as I immediately planned for the following week. DAY 3 saw Chris Adams and Lauren Freda debut, along with a man whom I'd meet for the first time and am proud to say one of my very best friends, Dan Spengeman. Thank you Facebook.\nDAY 4 once again increased in participation, most notably for me, old friend Ryan McCrorey. Perhaps Ryan would agree that the only time we had hung out was through a mutual friend. Those days are over however as dodgeball brought new life to an old friendship. Through Ryan, much like his soon-to-be \"Most Intense\" award winning partner Steve, new players tried their luck at dodgeball. New friends were made instantly. DAY 4 was also the last time that the charismatic and hilarious Kevin Megill would play.\nAs the weeks progressed, new challengers stepped up to the plate. More and more regulars were making a scene: Mike Sputz at D-DAY 5; Derek Carty (older brother of Kyle) at D-DAY VI; cousin of the Adams' brothers Dan Karen at DAY 4; among others.\nThe events continued onward with intense matches and rivalries. Then DODGEBALL VII hit, which is arguably the most memorable of all events for one reason; it rained like hell. There were only 15 of us that night, but many that were there even to this day, love that event the most. DODGEBALL 9 would be another rainy night as 19 competitors stepped onto the court. VII and 9 would be the only two rainy events. I think it makes them more special.\nI cannot forget DODGEBALL 8 however. For me, this is when I saw the ball rolling as a \"new generation\" was ushered in. Similarly to that in WWE back in 1993/1994, Hogan was gone, Savage was leaving, among others. Bret Hart, Razor Ramon, Shawn Michaels, and newcomers like Diesel were filling in those spots of the fallen headliners. Now dodgeball has never really lost any of its main players, but newcomers were coming in. I think most would agree that Tom Adams was ready to take charge.\nWhen DODGEBALL X occured, I knew what to expect at least from my end. I had a planed award ceremony before hand. However, never would I have guessed gifts given to me. I don't know how to explain how that made me feel. Most very close to me know that 2005 was easily the worst year of my life, and knowing that I could still put a smile on someone's face even for three hours a week, was more than I could have imagined. I am not one bit embarrassed to admit that I cried after DODGEBALL X's end. It hit me hard. But I had work to do and that leads us into the unofficial new season.\nDODGEBALL XONE and XTWO were favorites in the eyes of many. The attendances shattered past records, the obvious fact that they were back-to-back events since the inception, and of course new players. Kevin Fitzpatrick, Lenny Herera, Matt Larsen, and Sara DeCuir became regulars after these events; Easily four of the best players around.\nDODGEBALL 13 and DODGEBALL XIV were two great events in themselves. The so-called 'Era of Devolution' continued at 13 and XIV was just an all-around outstanding night, headlined by one of my favorite captains feud between Derek Carty and Ben Cotta.\nProbably the most significant event ever was DODGEBALL 15. For all passionate players, you will remember that this was the very last night played at Ocean Road Park. DODGEBALL 15 gave us the first ever 'V-shot' delivered by Sara to Kristin, aka 'Beatles'. The attendance reached the second highest ever as well with an awesome 37.\nA new location went into effect immediately starting at DODGEBALL X6. No lights at Ocean Road Park, so what do we do? Like any passionate players, we head on over to the next best spot; the Wall High School tennis courts. Lights that we can control! Despite the new location, dodgeball did not lose a step. DODGEBALL 17 would follow in the footsteps of its predecessor, but also add in 'dark' dodgeball, when the lights had gone off.\nAnother double header hit when DODGEBALL 18 and 19 came. I wish I would have hyped up these two events a little bit better and gave players a little more notice, but I was still very pleased in both turnouts. Like all past events, these produced just as much fun.\nBut when DODGEBALL 19 ended, I can honestly say I felt the adrenaline pumping already for what would soon be the biggest one of them all ...\n..........\nDodgeball for me has been a mental anesthesia, and maybe for others as well. We all go through hard times in life and sometimes it's that one thing, that one passion that keeps us going. One of my few goals was to make it to DODGEBALL 20, the event we all await in just hours time. I can take as much credit as I want, but in reality, there wouldn't be dodgeball without all of you. Dan Spengeman said it best: 'Dodgeball is like your 'best friend convention' '. I like the sound of that.\nI can't believe it; DODGEBALL 20, 'The ClimaXX'. It couldn't have come at a better time either as it is the last event of 2005, closing out 'the year from hell' and turning it into a heaven. As crazy as it sounds, DODGEBALL 20 will be one of the greatest and certainly memorable nights of my life. Am I obsessed? Hell yeah, and damn proud of it (lol). But for good reason. I have expanded on old friendships and started great new ones. My friends are my family.\nThank you all for making a tiny dream into one large reality. I only hope you have enjoyed this journey as much as I have.\"\n- JOHN TRONOLONE -\nDecember 30th, 2005\n4:02 AM",
