The past couple of weeks have been rough with low attendances and temperatures dropping perhaps as the two biggest obstacles all players currently endure. But isn't it ironic that at our lowest point, dodgeball is set to be invaded? It appears as if timing is everything.\nI'm not saying this is going to 'bring back' dodgeball. One event couldn't do that. But it may just bring back the old cliques from the past year, allow the emergence of new stars, whether on our team or 'theirs'. All I know is that I'm excited, and if you plan on attending, you should be too. The 'fear' of the unknown may be what dodgeball needs right now.\"\nSeverity and Questions\n\"Now though I sound estatic about the future state of dodgeball, it would be an huge mistake if I forgot the severity of the situation. It's been said time and again, but for weeks, dodgeball has been spied on. Some of you may find the comments rather annoying and obnoxious. Others may simply ignore them. Whatever the case, it is crucial to ask the questions that will be answered come this Saturday night at DODGEBALL LX3.\nHow many are there?\nThis is probably the toughest question to answer. No one has any idea how many opponents lay in wait. It could be a small group of 5 of a mass of 20. I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say this; we'll be ready either way.\nWho are the invaders?\nFrom the toughest question to the most intriguing: who in the blue hell are these attackers anyway? The solution to this problem won't be resolved until LX3, but until then, several of you have voiced your opinions.\nCould it be the Ocean Township High School students, the same clan that verbally attacked us in the mid-March? Kevin Adams and Diana DiBuccio for sometime have felt it's more of an 'internal' invasion in Pond Scum, led by Ray Marzarella, Gerald Lewis, and Dan Turner. Justin Pierce is firm in his belief that it just may be a bunch Manasquan High School students. They have stuck their nose in our business before, and for once, will they have the guts to back up their words?\nMy view on it flips constantly. I haven't the slighest clue and honestly, I kind of like it that way.\"\nA Different Approach\n\"I think I've taken a new spin on things. All of us, together, should be flattered and maybe even a bit overjoyed at the fact that another dodgeball league, group, team, whatever they may be, has found interest in us. For over one year, we have found a way to make each and every weekend something to remember. Let's hope this is one of those times never to be forgotten.\"\n\"DODGEBALL LX3 could very well be the beginning of a long, grusome war. I have total faith in East Coast Dodgeball as we easily possess some of the most athletic competitors around. Let's all bring our 'A' game. I wouldn't doubt for a second that 'they' will too.
