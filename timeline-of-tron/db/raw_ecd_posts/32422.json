This event set a new record for the largest ball ever in play.\n> A high number of dodge balls were used throughout the event: 11.\n> The captains battle was easily one of the most memorable as not only new players showcased their talents, but the captains themselves. Sara DeCuir defeated Diana DiBuccio for the captains crown winning 5 to 3. This is Sara's first captains win ever, with a current record of 1-2. Diana's record is now at 1-2-1.\nToo Defeat Diana\nIt's a rivalry with no end in sight. Coming off the heels of her golden victory over Wesley Hebrew at the wild and rainy DODGEBALL 45, Diana knew that her first challenger would be no slouch.\nSometimes the closest of friends can make the best of enemies. Sara DeCuir and Diana DiBuccio have perhaps caused more harm and inflicted more pain that any other females in the history of dodgeball. They have eliminated opponents by the masses and despite much stiffer competition in these latter events, they still achieve great success. So when you put these two against each other for the captains crown, you know all hell will break loose.\nSara DeCuir, whose previous runs as captain earned her no wins, was looking to end that very losing streak. Diana, the current champ, had something to prove in that she could form the best of allies and go on to the next event carrying the gold.\nRight from the start, the match looked grim for Diana. Having only captured one win within the first two hours, the tide had turned and a new champion was going to be crowned. It wasn't a disasterous loss for Diana as recent events have shown. But at the end of the night the score stood in favor of the newly crowned champion Sara DeCuir. It was a tremendous effort by both competitors.\nSara DeCuir defeats Diana DiBuccio at DODGEBALL 46: 5 - 3.\nThe Superstars of DODGEBALL 46\nHaving only returned last week at DODGEBALL 46, Kevin Adams is without question one of the best around past, present, and future. Still only in his mid-teens, the youngest of the Adams clan has always shown a tremendous amound of heart, courage, and dedication each and every week he participates. Some feel he is the sole reason for Sara's victory as the many painball catches and thrown eliminations made him a tough obstacle to overcome.\nAnother important element at DODGEBALL 46 came with the big-mouthed general Justin Pierce. Admitting to having a rough day, it was that very anger that made him arguably the player of the night. He earned incredible catches, many of which he was the last player on his team. His awareness on the court proves to be at a high level as blocking comes so easy to this wily veteran. It was an all-around A+ performance, one to be admired.\nLooking beyond the established stars for just a second concerns that of some of the newblood. Brother-in-laws Emilio and Joseph, although on seperate teams, symbolically joined forces in saying that they are the hardest, most powerful throwers ever. If they do return sometime in the near future, you can bet they will have the very same impact.\nZach Katz is usually viewed as a powerhouse thrower, especially when talking about the dreaded painballs. But Zach's skills have always varied. When talking about his deflections, perhaps it was he that earned the top spot at DODGEBALL 46. Using nothing but his hand and a bulletball, \"The Big Kat\" was perhaps the hardest player to hit during the night.\nAnd lastly, another newcomer made quite the splash at the finale event of June. E.L., cousin of the recognized Carty Brothers, proved to be a force just like in-laws Joseph and Emilio. E.L. was also able to outlast many in the night's match, allowing him to eliminate more and more players as the event wore on. Hopefully he too will return down the road.\nThe 47th Installment, the First event of July: The Road to 50\nThe final month on the Road to 50 and there is no telling what is going to happen. Past history has shown that it is these three upcoming events that shape the very \"ten\" event which follows.\nAt DODGEBALL 47, Sara DeCuir will put the gold on the line against Derek Carty. A full preview will be out by mid-week.\nDODGEBALL 47 : WHS : 6:30 : Friday, 7.7.06",
