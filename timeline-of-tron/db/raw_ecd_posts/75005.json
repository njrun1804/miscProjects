And one thing was for sure; someones' \"perfect\" record was coming to a screeching halt.\nMembers of Team EDWARDS were overly thrilled at the chance to align with the most destructive captain of the modern era.

It was anybody's ball game from here on out ..\nAt every possible juncture throughout the fierce war, each army utilized their unlimited talents to claim the win. Neither man would fall that easily. The unforgiving rubber bulletballs ripped skin and numbed limbs.
