  "body_text": ">>> DODGEBALL X <<<\nUnreal. Unbelievable. Incredible.\nThose are just three words that help describe the biggest night in dodgeball history, DODGEBALL X. Those words, to many, are complete understatements.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nThe night started with a first; an award ceremony. Numerous players received \"Dodgeball Excellence\" awards for specific talents. Those awards included everything from most intense and best dodger, to hardest throwers and even perfect attendance. Ten awards were given out in total:\nMost Intense\nRYAN MCCROREY\nSTEVE ADAMS\nPowerhouse Throwers\nCHRIS ADAMS\nMIKE ROSINSKI\nBest Rivalry\nJUSTIN PIERCE vs DIANA DIBUCCIO\nMost Improved\nELIZABETH NOGUEIRA\nVALERIE WINSTON\nBest Dodging Ability\nDAN SPENGEMAN\nPerfect Attendance\nDIANA DIBUCCIO\nThe Hall of Famers certainly got the recognition they deserved as well. KJohn prepared speeches for each of them and also presented them with very nice certificates. Announced earlier in the week, those inductees were:\nDIANA DIBUCCIO\nLAUREN FREDA\nCHRIS ADAMS\nJUSTIN PIERCE\nMIKE ROSINSKI\nDAN SPENGEMAN\nThe awards for the night were not done however. The self-proclaimed \"King\" was unaware of the surprises that had yet to come.\nMike Rozz went first and presented a WWE Championship foam belt as a token of his appreciation. A great surprise to the say the least. But that was only the beginning ...\nRyan McCrorey came up and presented a crown to John, deeming him the \"KOD\", or the \"King of Dodgeball\". If that does not boost John's cockiness and arrogance, nothing will. It was another great surprise, but even that was not the end ...\n\"Quick Sand\" Dan was the last presenter in this trio of gift-givers. A framed certificate of appreciation was given to John. Dan was not through though as he pulled out a brand new Sports Authority Dodgeball, and had everyone in attendance sign it. He also bought a small stand so the ball would be able to be put up on a shelf.\nKJohn was pretty much speechless as he really never knew what dodgeball had meant to some of the other players. All gifts were certainly unexpected making them that much more special.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nKevin Adams vs. Steve Adams, two brothers, was the highlight rivalry of X for one main reason; they were Captains.\nIt was an awesome match as 24 of the finest athletes around made their way to Ocean Road Park to celebrate this milestone 10th installment of dodgeball. The victories went back and forth as both teams seemed to be evenly matched. But around mid-point, \"The Hurricane\" Steve Adams and his team took the game to a whole new level to a point of almost total domination. Winning at least 4 games in a row, it was almost impossible for Kevin and his team to make any sort of comeback. The final score was 9 to 6; a valiant effort by both teams. But with a final score like that, one question seems to boggle the mind ...\nCould there be a reason why the teams seemed a bit miss-matched?\nThe answer might not be to hard to figure out. Perhaps it was Steve Adams himself who siked out his opponents tremendously. Seriously, who else who would wear a mask and green cape to dodgeball?\nIt certainly provided for one memorable picture.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nAs tradition, standout players deserve their recognition ...\nRyan McCrorey, who was awarded \"Most Intense\", could have easily played at his best at X. Numerous catches, great throws, and intensity that intimidates any opponent showed all players why he is a force to be reckoned with.\nThe youngest competitor currently in dodgeball arguably played at his best as well. Jim Martin is not to be looked passed one bit. After having some trouble throwing in the early going, this quick and intense player changed it up a bit and brought out a side few have seen; catching. His catches throughout the night could very well be the sole reason why Steve and company were victorious.\nGuts and determination are two perfect words when describing Mike \"Sputz\". At DODGEBALL 8, this fierce competitor seriously injured his foot and because of doctor's orders, was not allowed to do any intense activity. He sat out of DODGEBALL 9 much to his dismay. But at DODGEBALL X, going against doctor's orders, and with the injured wheel, he made his comeback and played one hell of a game for someone not even close to 100%. That is just a lot of heart which is certainly worth noticing.\nHall of Famer Dan Spengeman, in the eyes of many, is the hardest player to eliminate from the game. Even some of the bigger guns like Justin Pierce and \"The Creation\" KJohn voiced their frustration several times during the night. It becomes nearly impossible when Dan has a ball, which many times he uses for blocking.\nJohn Watters, known to some as John \"#3\" [because of his trademark blue sweatshirt], is a silent assassin. A very quiet player, but can easily do some damage to any opposing team. Playing baseball has certainly helped this southpaw on the dodgeball court as he has one of the most deadly arms in the game.\nAnd as a final tidbit, there were some special appearances made at X. Ellen C, Rob P, Melissa S, Caitlin B, and Hall of Famer Lauren F provided some additional fun for the night. Ellen was the special photographer for the evening providing some great shots all can enjoy. Lauren was unfortunately on the injured list but made herself right at home on the court.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nDODGEBALL X has come and gone, but the memory of it will last a lifetime. It was unquestionably the coldest dodgeball event ever, but even that did not stop these men and women from playing a game they all love. DODGEBALL X lived up to the hype in every way.\nAnd what better way to end the DODGEBALL X results than with this:\n*Top: John W, John T, Kurt G, Derek C, Kyle C, Tom A, Valerie W, Diana D, Steve A, Lauren F, Chris A\n*Bottom: Dan K, Justin P, Ryan M, Kevin A, Jim M, Dan S, Ben C\n*DODGEBALL X participants not pictured:\nMike R, Kathleen R, Bill P, Christian N, Allison B, Liz N, Mike K\n>>> DODGEBALL X <<<",
