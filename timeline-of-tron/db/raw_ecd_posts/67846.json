  "body_text": "And Then There Was One ...\n... one event where sacrifices create riches beyond measure.\nAnd Then There Was One ...\n... one climactical battle where passion and desire turn to immortality.\nAnd Then There Was One ...\n... one night to show our peers and prove to ourselves what we're made of.\nTwenty-three months, 300 hours of competition, 311 warriors ... this was it.\nThe expectations for this milestone couldn't have been higher.\nThe near-uncontrollable anticipation had been brewing for months all in preparation for the single, biggest attraction in the history of the game. Six of the most recognized legends ever -\nPierce, Edwards, K. Adams, Fitzpatrick, Letsche, Tronolone\n- competed in the most ruthless, barbaric 5-hour war for all the marbles. Sweat profusely dripped, blood painlessly shed, all in an effort to come out the sole survivors of this inaugural three versus three encounter. And there wasn't a bigger stage for it all to go down than DODGEBALL 100!\nIf there was ever a main event that couldn't be replicated or recreated, this would definitely be it. Ten ultra-competitive games where respected veterans and hungry newbies eagerly readied to kick some major ass; Megill, the Winstons sisters, Hill, Herrera, Poalillo, Stopa, Avakian, Grasso, Londono, Turner, and that's only a fraction!\nDODGEBALL 100 kicked off with the dream team of Pierce, Edwards, and Adams taking the inaugural round. The attempt to rebound back from this defeat went on without a hitch as Fitzpatrick, Letsche, and Tronolone took not one, but the next two games that followed. But the night was young and to say the competition rose to a new, unparallelled level would be an understatement.\nThe \"that's gonna leave a mark\" bulletball shots continued into the late-evening hours with a rather sudden change in the guard. The mega-trio Pierce, Edwards, and Adams had come back from their measly one point to score three straight victories in Games 4, 5, and 6. Now with four wins under their belt, the iconic team was just over an hour away from putting an end to this free-for-all.\nBut in the seventh round, Fitzpatrick, Letsche, and Tronolone figuratively yelled \"no more\" to the vicious slaughters they had just received and turned the tables on their merciless rivals. Catching everything in their paths, Game 8 produced the exact same result and the already-memorable showdown was all tied up with an awaiting Game 9 coming up!\nThis ninth contest had to have been the most crucial of the entire evening. DODGEBALL 100 was coming to a close in less than a hour - either dream team capable of walking away with their arms raised in triumph. After a 20 minute struggle full of the high-octane, intense action felt throughout the centennial, Pierce, Edwards, and Adams came up big when they needed to most, pulling ahead 5 - 4. The legendary trio then hammered the nails in the coffin at the conclusion of a rather quick tenth round - Pierce, Edwards, Adams leave with not only the biggest win of their careers, but in the history of dodgeball.\n\"Dream Teams\" collided ...\nJustin Pierce\n,\nMike Edwards\n, and\nKevin Adams\ndefeated\nKevin Fitzpatrick\n,\nRyan Letsche\n, and\nJohn Tronolone\n, 6 - 4, at dodgeball's 100th spectacle.\nSeason 10\n~ An incredible season ...\nThe CREAMation 2\n, the first-ever Quadruple Birthday, two vicious\nWall v. All\nbattles,\nMegill v. Edwards II\n, the return of the\nHit the Human\nContest, and the six DODGEBALL 100 Captains Drawings along the way.\n~ Average attendance was 28.8, with a total of 31 new stars.\n~ Only one\nWet War\n: DODGEBALL 91.\n~ Mike Edwards, Juan Londono, Diana DiBuccio, Kevin Megill, Justin Pierce, and John Tronolone attended all ten Season 10 events.\nDODGEBALL 100\n~ Decorations included streamers, streamer-flags, Christmas lights, balloons, a strob light, and yes, even a fake palm tree.\n~ The amount of food was simply astounding: chips and salsa, three batches of brownies, two batches of cupcakes, a large bowl of watermelon, and Dunkin' Donuts Munchkins. Don't forget the drinks - gallons of water, a soda-filled cooler, and a large cooler of icea tea.\n~ Thanks to the creative and thoughtful Lauren Winston, those that stayed to the end were given Goody Bags!\n~ The 50/50 Raffle earned $56, won by Kevin and Steve Adams.\n~ First round pick for\nPierce/Edwards/Adams\n: Kevin Megill.\n~ First round pick for\nFitzpatrick/Letsche/Tronolone\n: Mike \"Sputz\" Krott.\nOH Tracks!\nWhat a compilation - one hundred chart-topping, energetic anthems from the 80s, 90s, and today! Aerosmith's \"Dude Looks Like a Lady\", Crazytown's \"Butterfly\", a live version of \"Down\" by 311 - plus, the inclusion of every past ten event theme song made this collection that much sweeter; Metallica's \"Fuel\" (DODGEBALL XL) and \"Hey Man Nice Shot\" by Filter (DODGEBALL 20) just to name two. This was one playlist competitors and stectators alike were singing and groovin' too.\nDODGEBALL 100 will be embedded into the hearts and minds of all those involved, and here's a few reasons why:\n~ Juan Londono, Joe McCormick, Joey Smalls, among others receiving impactful nutshots.\n~ Mike \"Sputz\" Krott's \"Ultimate Warrior\"-look.\n~ Pam D'Luhy's terrific eliminations.\n~ Tom Adams on the receiving end of a water-gun prank.\n~ Bulletballs popping the balloons hanging on the opposite court.\n~ The numerous double-eliminations, mainly due to the extraordinary attendance.\n~ Sascha Basista's Game 10 elimination on Ryan Letsche sent the captain into a frightening, yet comical rage all over the court.\n~ Kevin Fitzpatrick hitting three rimshots on the night.\n~ Lindsay Gough's brave \"run-thru\" with the \"Yield to Dodgeballs\" sign.\n~ Dan Turner kneed in the face during an opening rush by\nPondScum\nally Ray Marzarella.\n~ Liz Nogueira's funny faceshot on Brent Bitsko.\n~ The thrilling mid-court showdowns between competitors.\n~ Diana DiBuccio's \"Que!\" Nazi-march during the song \"Umbrella\" by Rihanna.\n~ Kevin Adams suffering two leg cramps towards the end of the night and still competing to the best of his ability.\n~ The sideline wrestling match between Simon Poalillo and John Tronolone.\nDODGEBALL 100 established a\nbrand new attendance record\nfor any event with an astounding\n52\nparticipants. The previous record was held at both DODGEBALL 41 and DODGEBALL 50, each with 47.\nThere were 41 male participants [\nNew Record!\n] and 11 female participants.\nDODGEBALL 100 welcomed\nthree new stars\nin Jason Teitelbaum, Dave Curtis, and Bob Cornero.\nDODGEBALL 100 was the record-setting fourth season finale [following DODGEBALL XL, DODGEBALL LX, and DODGEBALL 90] played on the back courts of Wall High School. It was the third to include the popular\nLetsche Rims\nas form of team regeneration.\nDODGEBALL 100 ran from 5pm to 10:30pm; one of the longest events on record.\nThere was a record-breaking four theme songs in all; Puddle of Mudd's \"Famous\", \"She Builds Quicks Machines\" by Velvet Revolver, Chevelle's \"Saturdays\", and \"Paradise City\" by Guns N' Roses.\nNot surprisingly, there were several notable returns:\n-- Kyle Carty (Last appearance at DODGEBALL 47)\n-- Brent Bitsko (Last appearance at DODGEBALL LVII)\n-- Joe McCormick (Last appearance at DODGEBALL LX3)\n-- Michael Schuman (Last appearance at DODGEBALL LXIV)\n-- Jim Martin (Last appearance at DODGEBALL 70)\n-- Kathryn and Liz Nogueira (Last appearance at DODGEBALL 87)\n-- Ryan McCrorey, Zach Katz, Derek Carty, Lindsay Gough, Robert Brown, and Steve Adams returned after several weeks of inactivity.\nDODGEBALL 100 played host to the first \"3 vs. 3\" captains showdown, featuring six of the absolute best ever. Justin Pierce, Mike Edwards, and Kevin Adams would go on to defeat Kevin Fitzpatrick, Ryan Letsche, and John Tronolone by a final score of 6 - 4.\n--\nJustin Pierce\nmade his second ten event captains appearance, having headlined DODGEBALL 90 against Tom Adams. Since DODGEBALL 90, Pierce has yet to lose a match, improving his record to 3-1-0.\n--\nMike Edwards\nmade his second ten event captains appearance, having headlined DODGEBALL 80 against Kevin Megill. Edwards remains an undefeated captain with an impressive 3-0-1 standing.\n--\nKevin Adams\nmade his third ten event captains appearance, having headlined in DODGEBALL X and DODGEBALL 50. He became the first competitor in history to reach seven victories, now with a record of 7-2-0.\n--\nKevin Fitzpatrick\nmade his second ten event captains appearance, having headlined DODGEBALL 70 against Chris Adams. He has established a record of 3-2-0 following DODGEBALL 100.\n--\nRyan Letsche\nmade his ten event captains debut. His record after DODGEBALL 100 is 2-3-0.\n--\nJohn Tronolone\nmade his record-setting fourth ten event captains appearance following DODGEBALL 20, DODGEBALL 30, and DODGEBALL LX. He is the first competitor to captain a team ten times. This loss at DODGEBALL 100 put him at 3-7-0; the first player in history to lose seven times.\nThe winners of the 50/50 raffle were DODGEBALL 50 co-captains and two of the four famed Adams brothers. Kevin Adams and Steve Adams each walked away with a nice $28 prize.\nExcluding DODGEBALL 100 newblood, the following competitors made their ten event debut: Brad Burton, Jeff Hill, Brian Irons, Justin Wolf, Quatryle Johnson, Robert Pellecchia, and Joey Smalls.\nJohn Tronolone and Kevin Adams are the only two competitors to have partaken in all 10 season finale events.\nThere is a long list of participants and spectators who contributed to this \"summer sizzler\", whether it was setting up the colorful decorations or baking tasty treats.\nFood and Drink Contributions\nThanks!\nto Rob Avakian, Lauren Stopa, Mike Butler, Pam D'Luhy, John Tronolone, Mike Edwards, Diana DiBuccio, Kevin and Mary Megill, Kathryn and Liz Nogueira, Samantha DiFilippo, and Juan Londono.\nOH Tracks!\nSoundtrack\nThanks!\nespecially to Lauren Winston for the use of her iPod and John Tronolone for putting the soundtrack together. Kathryn Nogueira, Dan Spengeman, and Michael Tronolone are also thanked for their various contributions towards an amazing playlist.\nThe Pomp and the Pageantry\nSpecial\nThanks!\nto Lauren Winston, Valerie Winston, and John Tronolone for their time and effort, setting up several hours before showtime. Justin Pierce, Lauren Stopa, Ray Marzarella, Juan Londono, Simon Poalillo among others, also lent a helping hand in the process.\nOther Thanks\nTables were provided by Kevin Fitzpatrick and John Tronolone, so again, thanks are in order.\nAnd of Course ...\nCouldn't forget thanking each and everyone of you who came out and celebrated the pinnacle of\nour\namazing journey, DODGEBALL 100. All of us,\ntogether\n, have made this what it is today. The expectations were extremely high for this centennial, and by god,\nwe\ndid it.\nDODGEBALL 100: The one and only ... now rank it.\n10 ... Can't wait to tell my kids.\n9 ... Unbelievably successful.\n8 ... A great time.\n7 ... Pleasing.\n6 ... Not too shabby.\n5 ... ehhh.\n4 ... Rather disappointed.\n3 ... Pretty awful.\n2 ...
