  "body_text": "EVENT BACKGROUND\nEast Coast Dodgeball\nmade its long-awaited return to the Wall High School battlegrounds following a brief hiatus during the rather calm and snowless 2011/2012 Winter season.\nWORLD TOUR\nwas placed in a standard evening timeslot on Saturday, April 7, 2012, making it the remarkable 168th event held on the said day of the week. Event announcements and invitations were made possible via Facebook and text message.\nMAIN ATTRACTIONS\nThree main attractions* were showcased throughout the near four-hour WORLD TOUR presentation.\nThe first of these was the ultra-rare\nHitTheHuman Contest\n, a special pre-match competition absent since\nJune 2008\n. In the end, 2011 sensation\nJoanice Lima\ndeservingly captured the championship against an impressive 16 other contenders. As per tradition,\nECDElite\nHall of Famer Justin Pierce served as the \"victim\" for the game.\nUpon the completion of the\nHTH Contest\n, the more recognized\nRimshot Contest\ntitle was up for grabs. With an even more staggering 17 opponents,\nECDElitist\nJustin Wolf\ncame out triuphant.\nAs a result of their victories, the newly-crowned contest champions formed two formidible squads to kick-start the predominant match of WORLD TOUR. By the 10pm mark, Team ONE escaped with 5 total wins to Team TWO's 3.\n*It should be noted that while a Battle Royal was scheduled, the unusually long duration of both accuracy-testing contests scrapped the idea.\nSTATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE\nTwenty-one\n(21) participants helped establish a strong attendance in the 2012 opener. No new players were recorded.\nJoanice Lima became the first woman in\nECD\nhistory to win the\nHitTheHuman Contest\n.\nJustin Wolf's\nRimshot Contest\nvictory was also one for the record books as he joins an exclusive list - John Tronolone, Ryan Letsche, Diana DiBuccio - to win both a\nRimshot Contest\nand\na\nBattle Royal\n(earned in April 2008). Additionally, he was the 1st\nECDElitist\nto claim the contest crown post-induction.\n________________________________________\n_____________________\nThe Engagement Ring, The Wedding Ring, The Suffering.\nFATAL ATTRACTION\nis coming MAY 12, 2012!",
