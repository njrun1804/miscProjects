  "body_text": "> Attendance: 12 (Tied for the lowest along with DAY 1 and DODGEBALL XXX-ONE)\n> New Players: (2) Hillary C. and Matt C.\n> The captains for the event were Melanie W and Hillary C, neither of which had even been captain.\n> Prison Ball returned mainly due to the low turnout.\n> DODGEBALL 36 was the eighth \"Wet War\", following VII, 9, TWENTY-TWO, XXV, TWENTY-SIX, 30, and 32. The rain was said to be the worst of any previous \"Wet War\". It was a constant downpour from beginning to end.\n> DODGEBALL 36 was played on the back courts of Wall High School.\n> Although the events are never timed, DODGEBALL 36 might have been the shortest. The games didn't start until at least 7:30. The last match ended around 8:30.\n> Lenny Herrera's participation at DODGEBALL 36 tied him with Justin Pierce for the longest string of events in dodgeball history. If Lenny attends DODGEBALL 37, he would have had attended 27 events in a row, [beating the old record of 26]. On top of that, Lenny has never missed an event, debuting at the very first November event, DODGEBALL XONE.\n-----------------------------\nDespite a low turnout, the amount of fun lasted throughout the entire event. The teams were comprised very easily, lead by two of the newest women to the game.\nCaptain MELANIE W.\nLENNY H.\nJOHN T.\nKEVIN M.\nKEVIN A.\nZACH K.\nCaptain HILLARY C.\nTOM A.\nSTEVE A.\nDAN C.\nMATT C.\nDIANA D.\nAfter back and forth competition, the deciding game would end the  1 to 1 tie. After the departure of a few players, Hillary's team still took home the victory despite the odds not in their favor. The final score was 2 to 1.\n-----------------------------\nA wet and wild event it was just days ago at DODGEBALL 36. Already being compared to the horrendous DODGEBALL TWENTY-TWO back in January, DODGEBALL 36 saw a constant downpour and heavy winds. The only difference is that of the temperature. It was not as cold as that freezing January 14th event.\n-----------------------------\nDODGEBALL 37, Steve Adams's favorite number, is one of those events where most would agree they have no idea what is going to happen. Attendance once again took a dive, the weather is apparently back to being inconsistent, and the situation in regards to popular venue is an ongoing struggle between players.\nHowever, they certainly keep dodgeball interesting, especially with the addition of new types of games and locations (i.e. Prison Ball and the back courts of WHS, respectively). The story never gets dull, and it's safe to say, it never will.\nThe game continues this coming Friday, the 28th.\nCheck back later in the week for the announcement concerning location.",
