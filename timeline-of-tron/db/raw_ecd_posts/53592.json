  "body_text": "\"The glory of the masses of friends coming together in celebration of friendship and good sportsmanship shall live in our memory always ... The stories shall continue into our future generations to come.\"\n- ALISON BERTSCH\nThat's what it's all about. Those who strive on the weekly competition could relax even for a few minutes and just enjoy the company of one another. And for one icon, it'll be a celebration never forgotten. Welcome to Justin Pierce's brithday bash!\nThe decorations were up, the cake was out, dodgeball's finest stars has arrived ...\nBecause of this special occasion, Justin ruled DODGEBALL 78 as he saw fit. Stipulations, gametypes, and even the captains were handpicked by the legend.\n>> Juan Londono vs. Chris Adams\nHere's a smash-mouth, and rather unlikely encounter. The experienced Chris Adams going one-on-one with recent star Juan Londono in only the second\nPick Your Poison\nmatch. Under\nPrison Ball\nrules, all hell was sure to break loose at dodgeball's 78th spectacular.\nThere was no \"ifs\", \"ands\", or \"buts\" about this one. Chris chose one unstoppable team for that of his foe, a team that would eventually lead to his downfall at DODGEBALL 78. Team JUAN was fearless in their attempt to conquer Team CHRIS, and game after game, the wins racked up for the first-time captain. With powerful arms and witty plays like the controversial \"Prison Pyramids\", Chris indeed picked his own poison, the poison that killed any chances of him winning.\n- Perhaps the biggest assets on Team JUAN were that of the women. The talented Melissa Kerr scored elimination after elimination, as did the powerful Alison Bertsch. Diana DiBuccio sent her share of enemies to the sidelines and was relentless in her defensive efforts.\n- Though always outnumbered, Sascha Basista and Ryan McCrorey were consistently the last remaining players for Team CHRIS, so props are certainly in order.\nJuan Londono soundly defeated Chris Adams, 3 - 0, in only the second [captains] shut-out win in dodgeball's year and half history.\nThe night was called off unsually early do to the sudden knee injury of one Lauren Stopa. We hope to have an update on the fallen\nFemale Titan\nin the coming days.\nMoments:\nthe Dodgeball Pinata, \"Prison Pyramids\" thanks to the \"backing\" of Rob Avakian and Lenny Herrera, Tim Burns's running nutshot compliments of Tom Adams, and the overall celebration for one Justin Pierce.\nRECORDS SECTION\n> Attendance: 22\n> Biggest Return: Darien Brown (Last played at DODGEBALL 33)\n> New Players: (1) Tim Burns\n- DODGEBALL 78 hosted Justin Pierce's 23rd surprise birthday party, organized by Lauren Stopa and Diana DiBuccio.\n- Justin picked captains, stipulations, and gametype of his choosing.\n- DODGEBALL 78 hosted only the second\nPick Your Poison\nmatch. Chris Adams has been featured in both, the first at DODGEBALL 75.\n- DODGEBALL 78 was contested under\nPrison Ball\nRules, ending around 10:20pm.\n- Juan Londono scored only the second [captains] shut-out victory in history [following Kathryn Nogueira's defeat of Aimee Savoth at DODGEBALL LXV].
