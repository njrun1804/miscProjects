Letsche: 1, 2, 4; Vetrano: 3, 5\nWhat do you think of these magnificent athletes, each taking it to their absolute physical limits to keep their captain free from public embarrassment?!\nThe bad \"blood\" was all too prevalent between this pair of cousins, leading to this eagerly-anticipated confrontation. Add in the 2007\nNew CONCEPT of the Year\nstipulation, and you've got a collision of epic proportions.\n\"Killer\" Kerr, \"Maniac\" Mills, \"The UnSTOPAble One\", \"The Crazy One\" were all present. Pierce, K. Adams, DiBuccio, Megill? Just another day in the office for these respected veterans. And much praise to the newbies of this 139th spectacular - well done.\nThe Rules\n: Classic two-team match-up.\nThe Match\n: In a possible preview of next week's \"Family Affair\", Ryan Letsche defeated his cousin Bobby Vetrano, 3 - 2, in the 7th\nCREAMation Rules\nmatch.\nCaptain Statistics\n: Letsche 4-5-0 / Vetrano 0-2-0. Letsche became the first player in history to win two\nCREAMation Rules\nencounters (see\nDODGEBALL 125\n). He's only the third competitor [along with V. Winston and Tronolone] to partake in two as well.\nMoments & Stars\n: the Game 1 \"last man standing\" showdown between captains Letsche and Vetrano; Steve Pham's incredible double catch; Melissa Kerr sagging; Mike Edwards in a purple pimp costume\nAttendance\n: 22 competitors, comprised of 18 men and 4 women\nNew Players\n: Justin McCurdy, Cris Belfer, Andrew Feiter\nOther Notes\n: Season 14 is the first ten-week program to feature two separate\nCREAMation Rules\ncontests, the first of these in late-March at\nDODGEBALL 131\n. This was also the first\nCREAMation\nto feature chocolate whipped-cream. Music for the event was provided by Captain Letsche's iPod.\nA Message from \"The Writer\"\n\"How could I possibly ever disappoint you people? Sure you'd never be able to recognize me on the street, but I do care. I hope you thoroughly enjoyed DODGEBALL CXXX9 and a special thanks to both Bobby Vetrano and Ryan Letsche for having the brass to participate in a contest of this kind.
