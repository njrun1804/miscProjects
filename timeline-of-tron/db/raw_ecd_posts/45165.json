  "body_text": "\"Get Ready ...\"\nAnd then it happened.\nLights out!\n.......\nThose that can still remember a chilly DODGEBALL X6 will never forget the sudden transition from Ocean Road Park to Wall High School. Nearly one year later, a problem very much the same served as the main focus at DODGEBALL LXIV. There was no invasion, no winner-take-tourny, and interestingly enough, no Pond Scum. It was supposed to be a classic night with returning superstars and a females-only captains confrontation.\nThe Story of LXIV\nThe brightest of lights shining upon the very tennis courts that have caged in competitors of all ages and sizes are usually the first thing players see upon arrival at Wall High School. But LXIV was different than all the rest right from the start. John Tronolone, Kerrin Marchese, among others pushed the button as many times as possible in hopes the lights would indeed go on. But it was not to be. Even worse, no one knew the reason why.\nWould play revert back to its birthplace of Ocean Road Park?\nDan Spengeman knew first-hand that ORP wouldn't be the place to be; its lights were out too.\nAfter much deliberation in the parking lot, it became clear the only way to compete at LXIV was via a single\nlamppost\n.\nThose familiar with WHS know of three yellow lights that shine on the front tennis courts. Now although the WHS tennis lights came on at about 8:08, it wasn't long after the courts were black again. It was this one lamppost that kept LXIV in tact, with teams vying for the victory as if nothing was different or strange at all.\nSpuratically during the match, the tennis lights would kick on, but yet again go off just minutes later. It is truly one dodgeball's biggest mysteries, perhaps never to be solved.\nTeam AIMEE SAVOTH vs. Team KATHRYN NOGUEIRA\nThe attempt to form teams went rather well as the courts were nicely lit during this portion. Debuting captains, a twin pair of female titans and mutli-time award winners Aimee Savoth and Kathryn Nogueira, were quickly chosen as the leaders for the evening. Once teams were formed, squads lined up, poised and ready for the opening rush. But again with the \"technical\" difficulties, the opening rush was seen by the small yellow lights thanks to the lamppost. The beginning of DODGEBALL LXIV began as \"Dark Dodgeball\", perhaps the rarest of gametypes not seen since late-Spring.\nIt was one of the shortest matches in history thanks in part to the on-court afterparty. But the records stand as Kathryn defeated Aimee 2 to 0.\nLuke's Pizza Party\nAfter the second game, a man simply known to dodgeball as Luke, delivered four free pizzas to players on a cold and breezy November night. To date, his first and only appearance at an event came during last week's mayhem. He promised then and there that the following week would see more of the cheese pizza that has become rather popular among dodgeball's finest athletes.\nThe afterparty took place under that damn lamppost yet again as players, new and old, shared stories and told jokes for the remainder of one of the most memorable events of the year. After the four pizzas were devoured, DODGEBALL LXIV concluded. Those that have seen everything in the game of dodgeball couldn't have been more pleased with LXIV as a whole.\nThe 64th Records\n- Attendance: 20\n- Biggest Return: Liz Nogueira (Last played at DODGEBALL XLIV)\n- New Players: (2) Macky R. and Sasha B.\n- Out of the 20 competitors, 9 of them were women. This is the highest percentage of female players at any event: 45%\n- \"Dark Dodgeball\", one of the lesser known game types, made its return for first time since DODGEBALL 41. The WHS lights went on and off several times during the night. As the story says, a single lamppost helped for the occasion.\n- DODGEBALL LXIV witnessed the debut of two new captains: Aimee Savoth and Kathryn Nogueira.\n- For the second week straight, pizza-man Luke delivered free pizza to the dodgeball gang. This time he brought four pizzas when compared to last week's one. Again, he is thanked for his generosity.\n- DODGEBALL LXIV returned to the Front Courts of WHS for the first time since DODGEBALL LVI two months ago. Trash cans were also used in the mayhem serving as the traditional \"rims\".\n- Though the event was billed as the \"Invasion Aftermath\", not one Pond Scum member was in attendance.\nThanksgiving Special\nAll that is left in November is the Thanksgiving weekend. If you can remember last year, DODGEBALL 15 almost broke the record for overall attendance, then held by DODGEBALL XTWO. Will the same success be duplicated at this Saturday's DODGEBALL 65? Be there November 25th to find out.",
