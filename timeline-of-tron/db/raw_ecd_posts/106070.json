Both carry a wealth of big-time match experience and will undoubtedly use such knowledge to gain the upper hand.

Winston and Tronolone purposely scheduled the match on March 24 because they were departing to\nWrestleMania 23\nthe following weekend and wanted to leave their peers with something special.\nVIDEOS:\nClick Here (Part 1)\n.\nClick Here (Part 2)\n.\nClick Here (Extended Video)\nCREAMation 2\n| June 9, 2007\nEVENT: DODGEBALL 91\nMATCH:\nJustin Pierce\nand\nJuan Londono\ndefeated\nDiana DiBuccio\n, 4 - 2.\nNOTES: Tom Adams was DiBuccio's scheduled co-captain but backed out of the match only hours before the event. Had DiBuccio been successful, she would have delivered pies to both Pierce and Londono. To date, this is still the first and only \"handicap\" captains contest.\nVIDEOS:\nClick Here (Part 1)\n.\nClick Here (Part 2)\nCREAMation 3\n| September 29, 2007\nEVENT: DODGEBALL 105\nMATCH:\nChris Adams\ndefeated\nKevin Fitzpatrick\n, 4(1)  - 4.\nNOTES: This was the second of three amazing matches between the two icons. It was originally scheduled for DODGEBALL 101, but Fitzpatrick's work schedule conflicted with that particular Saturday night. Because of their intense rivalry, Adams and Fitzpatrick participated in\nECD's\nfirst-ever one-on-one tiebreaker, eventually won by Chris.\nVIDEO:\nClick Here\nCREAMation 4\n| December 15, 2007\nEVENT: DODGEBALL 116\nMATCH:\nRyan McCrorey\ndefeated\nSascha Basista\n, 8 - 4.\nNOTES: The original match-up featured McCrorey and Travis Mills, but Mills was unable to compete due to personal reasons. At the last minute, Basista accepted both the match and stipulation perhaps later regretting his decision.\nVIDEO:\nClick Here\nCREAMation 5\n| February 9, 2008\nEVENT: DODGEBALL 125\nMATCH:\nLauren Stopa\nand\nRyan Letsche\ndefeated\nLauren Winston\nand\nGrant Cornero\n, 4 - 2.\nNOTES: Match announcement came by way of the\nECD TextMessaging System\nand was booked to further the on-court rivalries of Stopa-Winston and Letsche-Cornero.\nVIDEOS:\nClick Here (Part 1)\n.\nClick Here (Part 2)\nCREAMation 6\n| March 22, 2008\nEVENT: DODGEBALL 131\nMATCH:\nJohn Tronolone\ndefeated\nValerie Winston\n, 6 - 4.\nNOTES: Like the previous year, these two\nWrestleMania\n-bound combatants fought to provide one last laugh before their annual trip. The originally planned contest however featured all of the\nWrestleMania XXIV\nattendees: Travis Mills and Kristen Driscoll against Sascha Basista, Winston, and Tronolone.\nVIDEO:\nClick Here\nCREAMation 7\n| May 24, 2008\nEVENT: DODGEBALL CXXX9 (139)\nMATCH:\nRyan Letsche\ndefeated\nBobby Vetrano\n, 3 - 2.\nNOTES: This \"cousins contest\" served as the prelude for the following week's\nFamily Affair I\n.\nVIDEO:\nClick Here\nCREAMation 8\n| September 27, 2008\nEVENT: DODGEBALL 157\nMATCH:\nAlison Bertsch\ndefeated\nPamela D'Luhy\n, 2 - 1.\nNOTES: This female-only confrontation was planned a good 3 months in advance, with both Bertsch and D'Luhy actually requesting the match itself. It was purposely put on John Tronolone's birthday to add even more hype to the already anticipated event.\nVIDEO:\nClick Here\nCREAMation 9\n| November 22, 2008\nEVENT: DODGEBALL CLX5 (165)\nMATCH:\nJohn Tronolone\ndefeated\nRyan Letsche\n, 3(1) - 3.\nNOTES: The\nCREAMation\nstipulation was only for the then-undefeated Letsche while Tronolone's captaincy was on the line (\nWhite Flag\nstipulation).
