  "body_text": ">> DODGEBALL 33 Results <<\nDODGEBALL 33 is quickly being viewed as a preview for the upcoming months. After last week's seventh \"Wet War\", it's safe to say many were looking for a change as far as the weather was concerned. That change thankfully came, making the first April 2006 event truly a spectacle.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n>> BROWN vs. BROWN\nA first in the sport: two men with the same last name head-to-head, and they aren't related. Young prodigy Robert Brown met his match at DODGEBALL 33 in the elder veteran Darien Brown. With as many people on the court, better choose wisely. To say that neither captain didn't would be an incorrect statement.\nA very evenly matched event all the way around. Teams battled from pillar to post, trying to gain the upper hand in the night's series. Which \"Brown\" would come out the victor? It was triumph for the youngest of the two ... Robert Brown defeated Darien Brown, four to three.\nOf course there are many reasons for the win at 33. Superstar players made their mark ...\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n>> The BRIGADES of the BROWNs\nSince his debut at DODGEBALL DAY 3, Dan Spengeman has basically done it all. Between creating some of the best event posters to producing, editing, (etc.) the five-star \"Not JUST a Game\" documentary, Dan has unquestionably left an indelible mark on this great sport. At DODGEBALL 33, he stepped it up a notch, knocking out numerous opponents during each game. His blocking skills seemingly go unmirrored as you rarely see him a drop a ball upon collision.\nNext on the top players list would have to be Ryan McCrorey. It was if he had glue on his hands catching as much as he did, most notably with the almost impossible \"bullet\" balls. Swift dodges and overall feared intensity kept him in the games for quite a while. A game in which Ryan was still in, the opposing sideline just got longer and longer.\nJoe Kelly for weeks has packed in intensity like no one else. A very charismatic and funny player, you will rarely see Joe in the back of the pack. He is fearless in his attempts and somehow manages to stay in the games longer than most would expect. Joe could accurately be named the \"Human Kamakazi\".\nIf someone were to be awarded the \"Act of Courage\" award at the present time, it would probably go to Kevin Fitzpatrick. Just coming off the heals of a serious shoulder injury, he sucked up the pain and played a game that he is passionate for. He is no where near 100% yet, as he still has weeks of physical therapy ahead of him. However, many of his opponents still cowered in fear when he approached the line because they know he has undeniably made an impact since his debut in early November.\nThe ladies of the sport were just as unstoppable as the men. Two in particular had a good number of kills during the event. First there is Valerie Winston, who has been on a roll ever since the winter events. She had crucial kills, most notably on the legendary Tom Adams. And of course there is Sammy Smith, who has played only once at DODGEBALL XXVIII. But that didn't mean a thing as she had quite the throwing capabilites, launching harder than most of the women (and men for that matter) on the dodgeball playing grounds. She too had decisive eliminations, with perhaps her biggest on John Tronolone.\nJust like Dan Spengeman and Ryan McCrorey, without a thought Tom Adams also proved that he is one of the greatest of all time. The combination of he and Kevin \"Fitz\" gave Robert Brown's team two of the hardest throwers in the \"league's\" history. Despite receiving the most number of \"nut\" shots ever, Tom is a smooth dodger as well.\nA final note goes to one of the newest players. Steve Guarino, who debuted just last week at 32, has quite the arm for someone his age. He is sudden in his approach as well as the many times he dodges. Watch out for this young star; he is on the rise.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n>> The first April RECORDS:\n> Attendance: 34 (Fourth highest behind XTWO, 15, 20. Tied with 30)\n> Biggest Return: Casi Smith (Last played at DODGEBALL 21)\n> New Players: (5) Dan D, Christina N, Alex, Lenny W, Steve K.\n> DODGEBALL 33 marked the first time the far courts of Wall High School were used. This was because people were playing tennis on the other ones.\n> Human \"Rims\" were in play for the first time in history. Reason being the far courts are shorter than the normal ones.\n> \"Prison Ball\" and \"invasions\" were not seen at 33.\n> Two brand new captains were appointed at DODGEBALL 33; first time since DODGEBALL XXV.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n>> WHERE to Now?\nThere have only been three \"Double Headers\" in history. The first two events back in September were played on a Saturday and Sunday, respectively. The next, and arguably the most famous, were the highly populated DODGEBALL XONE and DODGEBALL XTWO events, which ushered in a new generation of players. The most recent would come one week before Christmas at DODGEBALL 18 and DODGEBALL 19, the final stops before \"The ClimaXX\", DODGEBALL 20.\nLooking ahead, the next of these back-to-back events is coming fast. However, all past \"Double Headers\" have been played on two consecutive nights. This coming weekend, that will change for the first time ever. Due to the amounts of physical pain in which these \"Double Headers\" can cause, this next one is played on a Friday and a Sunday.\nDODGEBALL XXX4\n- The first part of the weekend will indeed be a \"roll of the dice\". Like noted earlier in the week, it's \"trail and error\" at DODGEBALL XXX4, and for good reason. For now, let's just say there will be a new way of forming teams. It's a one time \"trial\", and so if all fails, back to traditional it is. DODGEBALL XXX4 takes place at Wall High School starting at the normal 7PM.\nDODGEBALL 35\n- The second half of the weekend returns to where it all began seven long months ago. It will only be the second daytime dodgeball event in history, with the other being the unforgettable DODGEBALL 30. Start time for this second \"Homecoming\" is at 3PM. Ocean Road Park hosts the event.\n......\nThere will be a one week break in dodgeball due to the Easter holiday (reason why there is a \"Double Header\" this weekend). The following is the schedule for the second half of \"Season 3\":\nSaturday, April 22nd ~ DODGEBALL 36\nFriday, April 28th ~ DODGEBALL 37\nSaturday, May 6th ~ DODGEBALL 38\nNormally it's understood that the events are played at Wall High School. However, revealing news has hit: the Ocean Road Park lights are back on. What will become of the second part of \"Season 3\"?",
