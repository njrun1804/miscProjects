I am tired of hearing comments about how someone used to be good, or how another player can't do this or that. We are friends, let's act like it. If you don't like someone on the court, oh well. Everyone knows the deal; anyone can play, so get used to it.\nWith these verbal 'invasions', it is simple; ACT YOUR AGE. There is no need to start cursing and mouthing off to a bunch of harmless teenagers. From personal experience, we will not be playing anymore if that keeps up because of 'noise pollution'. Neighbors will complain, TRUST ME. I appreciate what Lauren Freda did last week at XXX-ONE, as well as Chip at XXIV in calling the police. For some it seems like a cowards way out.
