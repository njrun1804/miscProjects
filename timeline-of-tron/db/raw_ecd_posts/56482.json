  "body_text": "After a week of inactivity, the popular game known as dodgeball returned to\nthe hallowed grounds of Wall High School, kicking off the inaugural event of April 2007.\nRIMSHOT CONTEST #6\nCertainly one of the most eagerly anticipated pre-games in quite some time. Hanging in the balance was a spot in the DODGEBALL 82 main event and the right to face first-time captain and dodging extraordinaire\nMike Butler\n.\nParticipants in the\nRimshot Contest\n: Melissa Kerr, Kevin Fitzpatrick, Mike \"Sputz\" Krott, Kurt Gassner, Max O'Rielly, 1-time contest winner Tom Adams, Alison Bertsch, Juan Londono, 1-time contest winner Sara DeCuir, Kevin Adams, Mike Edwards, 2-time contest winner Ryan Letsche, Ray Marzarella, and Justin Pierce.\nSurprisingly, only one superstar managed to hit the rim despite a combined 14 attempts. The winner of the 6th contest of its kind and now a 2-time victor, Sara DeCuir!\n>> Mike Butler vs. Sara DeCuir\nMike Butler was up against one of the all-time greats of the game. Sara DeCuir has been through hell and high water during her long, legendary career and certainly had all the experience heading into her big time match against the dodging maniac.\nBut an encounter that may have initially given the edge to Sara, did not turn out the way she had planned. It was a one-sided battle the entire night, with Butler picking up consective games during the three-hour onslaught. Team DECUIR was as hot and intense as ever, but it was just not enough to overcome the forces of Team BUTLER.\nThere was no dispute about this one. Mike Butler easily defeated Sara DeCuir, 7 - 1.\n\"It was cold ... and even though the team I was on lost, I  enjoyed every minute of it.\"\n- LAUREN WINSTON\n\"The final score did not tell the tale of last night's epic battle. Mike Butler, with a week to prepare for battle, was met with a fierce piece de resistance by Team DeCuir. Many games went down to the wire and could have gone either way.\"\n- MIKE EDWARDS\nMoments & Stars\n: spectacular dodging by a majority in attendance, Mike \"Sputz\" Krott's incredible one-handed catch while eating a slice of Luke's pizza, John Tronolone and Juan Londono both suffering bulletballs to the eye, the 14-person\nRimshot Contest\n, Kevin Megill's great string of catches\nThe 82nd RECORDS\n> Attendance: 24\n> Biggest Returns:\nMax O'Rielly (Last appearance at DODGEBALL 70)\nKurt Gassner (Last appearance at DODGEBALL 71)\n- DODGEBALL 82 featured the first Dan Spengeman-made poster since DODGEBALL FIFTY-FIVE in mid-September 2006.\n- DODGEBALL 82 hosted only the 6th\nRimshot Contest\n, the first since DODGEBALL LX.\n- The large tennis lights went off at 10:30pm, the latest they've stayed on since DODGEBALL LX3 in mid-November 2006.\n- Sara DeCuir became only the third player in history to win a second\nRimshot Contest\n(having previously won at DODGEBALL LX). She joins the likes of Ryan Letsche (51, FIFTY-TWO) and Chris Adams (50, 53).\n- Mike Butler's debut match witnessed him defeat Sara DeCuir. Sara has been captain more times than any other woman and is third in total number of times captain to Chris Adams and John Tronolone, both of whom have captained a team 9 times. Sara's record after 82 is 3-5-0.\n- DODGEBALL 82 was played on the one year anniversary of DODGEBALL XXX4.\nDODGEBALL 83\nAnother history making event in the works as the one and only Dan Spengeman supplies the dodgeball world with yet another creative poster. That will be released later in the week.\nThe big story however focues on the team generals ...\nTwenty Events Later\n... it's the true aftermath of the\nInvasion of LX3\nwhen\nDan Turner\ntakes on\nRay Marzarella\n. Prepare for the implosion of\nPond Scum\n!\nCREAMation\n2?\nBy popular demand, a second\nCREAMation Rules\nmatch is starting to take shape.
