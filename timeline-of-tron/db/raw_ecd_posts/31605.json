  "body_text": "The week leading up to DODGEBALL 45 had its share of surprises and shockers.\nOne of the most interesting rumors leading into the event was that a good number of recognized veterans would not be in attendance. As if that didn't put a slight damper on the event already, reports were also calling for horrendous weather. Hell, the captains match itself wasn't even set in stone until just one day prior to showtime. DODGEBALL 45 was looking to be a complete flop ...\nChamp Wesley Hebrew vs. Diana DiBuccio at DODGEBALL 45!\nA match that pitted fierce female legend Diana DiBuccio against young prodigy and reigning champion Wesley Hebrew turned DODGEBALL 45 into easily one of the most action packed events in history. Despite the lowest attendance ever recorded, the action was perhaps at its quickest than any other event. It was a true \"lightning war\" in more ways than one.\nIn the end, the power and agility of Diana's team reigned surpreme. In what turned out to be somewhat of a squash match, Diana becomes the first female captains \"champion\" with an incredible score of 7 to 3.\n- Kevin Adams's return to dodgeball couldn't have come at a more unorthodox event. But you could just see the determination in his eyes throughout the event. What an all-around performance for the youngest of the brothers Adams with impactful throws and swift dodges, two attributes that usually saw him the last remaining player on his team many a game.\n- John Tronolone may have been the star performer at DODGEBALL 45. He was eliminated only three times the entire event, hit rim at least twice, and even completely cleared out the opposing team in one of the many games. His dodging could very well be among the best the league has ever seen.\nBlitzkrieg Books\n> Attendance: 10 (Record Low)\nThis is the lowest attendance in dodgeball history. The previous low was 12, seen at three events; DAY 1, DODGEBALL XXX-ONE, and DODGEBALL 36.\n> New Players: 0 (Fifth time ever)\n> Biggest Return: Kevin Adams (Last played at DODGEBALL XL)\n> DODGEBALL 45 was the very first event of the Summer of 2006.\n> DODGEBALL 45 was \"Wet War IX\". From start to finish, 45 was played in the middle of a thunderstorm. It was the first \"Wet War\" since DODGEBALL 36 back in late April.\n> Tom Adams, Kevin Megill, John Tronolone, Kevin Adams, Kevin Fitzpatrick, and Wesley Hebrew all wore a bathing suit.\n> Wesley Hebrew vs. Diana DiBuccio was the third inter-gender captains battle following Sara DeCuir vs. Ryan McCrorey and Sara DeCuir vs. Joe Kelly at events X6 and 38, respectively.\n> Wesley Hebrew lost the captains crown at DODGEBALL 45, coming off his first and only victory against Lenny Herrera at DODGEBALL XLIV. Diana had previously been captain at consecutive events TWENTY-TWO and 23 in mid-January. She faced Alison Bertsch at both events.\nCaptains Records after 45: Wesley 1-1-1. Diana 1-1-1.\n> DODGEBALL 45 also broke the record for the fewest amount of female participants with only two; Diana DiBuccio and Alison Bertsch.
