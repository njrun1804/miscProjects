  "body_text": ">>> DODGEBALL XIV Results <<<\nAs the weeks continue onward, the temperature drops. However, past history has shown that not even mother nature itself will stop these gladiators from playing a sport they have a passion for. The 14th installment of dodgeball will be remembered for many, many reasons; the below-freezing temperature, the Cotta/Carty showdown, and of course, key players that changed the course of history. November 19th, 2005 was no let down by any means ...\nBen Cotta and Derek Carty, who debuted at DODGEBALL 8 and D-DAY VI [respectively], was the main event of the evening. Neither man had ever been captain before, so it was certainly their time to shine. The picks were quite interesting as this match-up is already being compared to the DODGEBALL XONE feud between Mike Rozz and Kyle Carty. Ben seemed to mirror one Mike Rozz, as a majority of his teammates were established veterans, including every single Hall of Famer possible to choose from. Derek on the other hand, similiar to his brother back at XONE, chose almost all newblood, all of which were ready to take down some supreme giants of this sport. The battle known as DODGEBALL XIV was ready to go down as 31 hungry competitors squared off for a jam-packed three hours of the most exciting game around ...\nRight off the bat, Ben's gang slaughtered their opposition. The first hour of play gave Ben 4 huge wins to Derek's 0. It was a rough start for the eldest Carty brother; would he and his team rebound back?...\nThe second hour brought the \"Carty Clan\" their very first win of the night. Cotta and his team of iron men did not collaspe however, seeing how they had racked up even more wins in this very same hour of play. Would the \"Carty Clan\" pull off the huge upset in the final, most crucial hour of the night?...\nThe destruction of one Derek Carty and his squad of newblood faced adversity right in the face, but went down, and went down hard. Ben Cotta had proven that his choosing of teammates were wise ones. The final score of the night was a crushing 7 to 2. Hats off to Derek and his amazing team though as not once did they show any sings of fatigue or quit. They continued right up until the end which, these days, is a very rare occurance. The COTTA vs. CARTY showdown will easily be remembered as one of the all time great rivalries.\nIn order for a rivalry to be good, one cannot forget the great displays of athleticism that go along with each event. DODGEBALL XIV gave us many stand-out performers, some well known, some on the rise. Either way, these competitors deserve the proper respect for an oustanding overall night of play ...\nJohn Watters is a silent, but deadly sniper-rifle. He has one of the most powerful arms in dodgeball today. Many players have expressed concerns over this young gun as he is becoming one of the biggest targets around.\nKevin Fitzpatrick, a newer player to the game, is also being closely observed. Much like John Watters, here is another man with a rifle arm. He too is a quiet player, but quickly making his presence felt on the dodgeball court.\nOne of the few legends on Derek's team was Steve Adams. Steve once again put on a steller performance, catching many balls during the night, 3 of which thrown by \"The Piercer\". Steve also provided one of the more memorable moments of this past dodgeball as well, with a brilliant sneak attack on one Diana DiBuccio.\nMany are viewing Valerie Winston as the player of the night. She acquired some crucial kills during the night, but more importantly, she caught like crazy. She has certainly proven why she was awarded \"Most Improved Player\" at DODGEBALL X, as her path of destruction continues to grow.\nAlthough he did not play, thanks go to Jim Martin, who suffered a broken ankle last week at DODGEBALL 13. He was the \"Countdown Master\" during XIV and although unable to play, he added fun for all.\nAnd as a final thought, thanks also go out to players who made their debut: Ken Kubes, Alysha Kelly, and Wesley Hebrew. These three rose the number of dodgeball players to 83.\nThe end of the DODGEBALL XIV results will conclude with two new profiles!\nThe final November showdown could be the blockbuster event. DODGEBALL 15 takes place on Saturday, November 26th, 2005. The promotional poster will be released at the start of the coming week.",
