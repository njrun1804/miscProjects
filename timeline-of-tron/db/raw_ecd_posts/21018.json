The last nine events have set the stage for what will be the biggest event of them all. DODGEBALL 21 started the new year of 2006 and what a ride it has been. Here are some classic moments:\nDODGEBALL 21\nThe third \"season\" kicks off with a bang! The Carty brothers return after a three-event hiatus and \"Sputz\" goes on a throwing and catching rampage factoring into the success of captains feud Lauren Winston vs. Liz Nogueira.\nDODGEBALL 27\n\"Lauren vs. Lauren\", cigar-smoking, male ponytails, and more make DODGEBALL 27 easily one of the most memorable ever.\nDODGEBALL XXV (\"Wet War IV\")\nThe 25th installment brought about the most newblood in a single night with an incredible 11. Add in that new players Gerald Lewis and Ray Marzarella were captains certainly \"mixed\" things up a bit.\nDODGEBALL XXVIII\nThe sixth highest attendance of 32 players is stamped into the record books. In a shocker, Justin Pierce also misses his very first event. New player Guy Ritt frightens many with incredible force packed into each throw.\nDODGEBALL TWENTY-TWO (\"Wet War III\")\nThe first \"Wet War\" in fourteen events arguably had the worst weather conditions in the history of the sport. Despite the below freezing temperature and sideways rain, 27 competitors made their way to Wall High School. To this day, it's the only event to not go beyond 2 hours.\nDODGEBALL XXIV\n\"Prodigy Captains\" Lenny Herrera and Matt Brown headlined the final event of January 2006. Other major happenings include Kevin Megill returning for the first time since DODGEBALL DAY 4, Steve Adams and Dan Spengeman missing their first events since their debuts, and a failed \"invasion\" of apparent Ocean Township High School students.\nDODGEBALL TWENTY-SIX (\"Wet War V\")\nThe second all-time lowest attendance of 14 players gathered for the love of a single game. Also for the second time, there wasn't one new player (following behind DODGEBALL XXIV). The night however was complete with charismatic captains Steve Adams and Kevin Megill.\nDODGEBALL 29\n\"Ultimate Poster Contest\" results are revealed, pictures are taken for the first time since \"The ClimaXX\", and Travis Mills head-to-head with Zach Katz brings all players one step closer to the \"homecoming\".\nDODGEBALL 23\nSometimes referred to as \"Dodgeball UHAUL\", the date of this event changed three times before going down. Despite the confusion, success was at hand especially with the weather. Most players will remember wearing T-shirts throughout the entire night.\nThree \"Wet Wars\", inconsistent turnouts, poster contests, strange weather, and more jam-packed these awesome winter months. The third \"season\" of dodgeball will conclude this Sunday, March 12.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nFor those who have yet to experience a \"ten\" event, they are truly something special. The music will be live and loud, the action at its finest, and the decorations around the court will create an unforgettable atmosphere and all-around phenomenal event.\nThere is still plenty more in the coming week continuing with the celebration that is DODGEBALL 30.",
