  "body_text": "Any one who has played dodgeball knows what it is like to wake up the next morning ... physically sore. Add in two back-to-back nights, and expect more pain and suffering.\nThe bomb was indeed dropped ...\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n>>> DODGEBALL 18 <<<\nWe start with Friday, Decemeber 16th. Only the third Friday event, this one was certainly no let down. Captains Bill Plantz and Ryan Letsche were ready for a battle, and boy did they ever get one.\nIt is quite simple really; Ryan dominated the competition the entire night. Bill got in his licks too, but it was Ryan whose team seemed hungrier on this first night of the double header. Letsche's allies turned out to be some pretty good ones ...\nIt seemed to have been ladies night at DODGEBALL 18. Diana DiBuccio was one of three women that went on a killing spree throughout the night. She was easily a key ingredient in her team\u2019s victory; throwing and especially catching for her were very good. Her and Sara DeCuir also escalated their rivalry, as Diana got the best of her new found rival. Could it have been a stroke of luck or mere experience on the court?\nNicknamed \"The Power Ranger\", Matt Brown debuted at the massive DODGEBALL 15 and has since made a statement like no other. The fact that he throws, dodges, and catches like many of the veterans has earned him the respect of those very veterans. Never underestimate the power of a 13 year old.\nLenny Herera in the early going was a catching machine. He even caught while sitting on the ground, which is a very rare feat in this great sport.\nOne has to give credit to Kevin Adams. Although right handed, he played with a broken left wrist. You would think that because of the injury, he would not be able to catch. However, that was not the case as he did make a few catches.\nBill's team had its share of iron men and women as well ...\nContinuing with ladies night, one has to include Lauren Freda and Valerie Winston. Once bitter enemies, these female titans formed an alliance, scoring elminination after elimination. After a performance like this, it makes one wonder just how good these two could be together as a unit in the future. If DODGEBALL 18 is any indication, never take your eyes off these two seasoned players.\nSteve Adams has probably provided more memories than any other player. He's one of few players that if he were to miss an event, the event itself just wouldn't be the same. DODGEBALL 18 was probably Steve's unluckiest night of them all as he was eliminated time after time, many the first one out for his team. That sure as hell did not stop him from having a great time though as he passed that very spirit on to everyone.\nJustin Godynick finally completed his mission ... Godynick aimed numerous times at his Hall of Fame foe and after several attempts, he at last had done it. \"The Piercer\" was hit in his leg after a bit of trash-talking. After Godynick's triumph, he went on to eliminate even more opponents, easily helping out his team in a big way.\nUnrelated in the physical team battle came a more mental game. KJohn Tronolone noticed Tom Adams\u2019s coat on the ground. What better way to get in the head of your opponent then to start mocking them. KJohn put on the coat and Tom, being the good sport that he is, gave KJohn his hat as well. For several minutes, KJohn became Tom Adams, obviously poking fun in the process. Tom however wasn\u2019t going to allow such antics to go on as his retaliation was even better; mocking \u201cThe Creation\u201d. Tom put on an act like no other, imitating the likes of KJohn and the stupid things that he does. Either way, it was a fun few minutes for all in attendance.\nThe first part of the double header turned out to be awesome. But a second half was awaiting the very next night ...\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n>>> DODGEBALL 19 <<<\nMuch like the night before, team domination was at hand. Two of the leagues biggest arms were captains: Zach Katz and Kevin Fitzpatrick. Teams were formed, enemies were met, leading right into the war intself ...\nIt was total destruction to say the very least, even more so than the night before. Kevin Fitzpatrick had formed the best of allies, no question. You would think even with less members on his team, he'd have no chance. That was certainly not the case. The details of the \"war\" are obvious just by looking at the score: 7 to Zach's 1. The \"war\" concluded a few minutes after the 7th win was recorded and the \"battle\" soon began. The \"battle\" was due in part to at least half of Kevin's team leaving dodgeball for the evening, leaving him and his troops at a huge disadvantage. Although Fitz lost two matches during this unfair time period, still his squad walked out victorious.\nThe Zach Attack:\nTravis Mills was a key player no doubt. He had some very sneaky attacks during the evening that sent many opponents to the elimination line.\nValerie Winston for the first time in months, was on opposite sides her best friend KJohn Tronolone. Nothing was settled what so ever as Val suffered six unforgiving eliminations, all courtesy her supposed \"best friend\".\nFor the second night in a row, Kevin Adams sucked up his injury and played a game that he loves. Again, he succeeded in being a key player and managed to score numerous eliminations as if nothing was even wrong.\nFitz Factor:\nJustin Godynick for consecutive nights was on fire. Similarly to DODGEBALL 18, his eliminations racked up. His final days of being 20 were great ones to him on the dodgeball court.\nMike \"Sputz\" Krott also used a similar style of offense when compared to Travis, considering he seems to be the one to have started it. He too stood at the sidelines and rocketed a ball with few opponents noticing. Mike \"Sputz\" can also say that he is famous for a \"nut\" shot. Opposing team captain Zach apparently had no idea what had hit him ... Zach was hit so hard by a fireball that he actually crawled off the court and onto the sidelines. Perhaps it was Mike's sunglasses which gave him the power to maim.\nAttendances:\nDODGEBALL 18 = 23 Players\nDODGEBALL 19 = 28 Players\nA final shot taken from DODGEBALL 19:\nDODGEBALL 18 and DODGEBALL 19 pictures are up and running. DODGEBALL 17 pictures and four new pictures from DODGEBALL X6 have also been added. Check out all these great shots at\nhttp://community.webshots.com/user/undertaker15yrs\nThe third double header in dodgeball history has come to a close. But as soon at DODGEBALL 19 ended, it began the countdown to the biggest one of them all ...\nThe date is set ...\nFriday, December 30th, 2005 ...\n*Special start time of 6PM*\nJust be ready.",
