You be the judge.\n----- Let the Beatings Begin -----\nFaceshots. They always seem to draw much attention. DODGEBALL 27 delivered with one of the most vicious in recent memory. When Mike \"Sputz\" throws, heads turn. But in this one specific incident, heads hurt. Lenny Herrera, one of several players to wear glasses, was temporarily \"blinded\" by what had struck him. Luckily for him, no permanant damage was done. As for \"Sputz\", 2006 is rockin' as he has been on the giving end of some of the most violent shots in dodgeball history.\nDespite being \"spun\" before the event's start, \"The Creation\" John Tronolone was looking to break a record at DODGEBALL 27. His throwing for the evening he himself has admitted could have been better. However, he took on a more \"Pierced\" role with \"rim\" shots. He hit 4 in one night, two of which were completely unnecessary. John on this night was Steve Adams, Travis Mills, and Justin Pierce all rolled into one.\nSpeaking of Intense award-winners Steve and Travis, what a comedic duo they made. Several times during 27, they repeatedly passed dodge balls to one another, confusing not only their opponents, but their very own partners. Much to their credit, their strategy worked a number of times.\nStill not at 100%, Kevin Adams proves why he is one of the toughest players ever. Just coming off a broken wrist, the youngest of the Adams brothers played great, especially with his many catches.\nThe only new player at DODGEBALL 27 made quite the splash. Dan Corran was one of the most fierce throwers of the eveving. This is a rookie with an agenda.\nHonorable mentions go to Dan Spengeman and Chris Adams. Dan missed the past three events and was fired up, ready to step back onto the court. He didn't disappoint with key eliminations by throwing. Chris Adams, who is quietly being referred to as \"The Undertaker\" of dodgeball, is unquestionably one of the best ever. Catches, throws, and dodges round out this highly respected veteran.\nThe main attraction could have been the path of destruction left by many of the females:\nThe colossal team of Lauren Freda and Valerie Winston were almost unbeattable during the evening. Lauren is a very sneaky sniper-rifle, as you never know when she is going to strike. Valerie, who has a very similiar style, also showed she is one of the best females around with several eliminations of her own. This duo, once bitter enemies, seem to make the best allies.\nSister of Valerie Winston, Lauren, is moving up the rankings quite nicely as well. She earned the very first elimination of the night on one John Tronolone, a first for the younger Winston. In recent weeks, it's been noticed the amount of players she eliminates is on the rise. That rise continued at 27 as she was a silent assassin, ready to fire at will at any unsuspecting player. The icing on the cake came with a life saving \"rim\" shot, easily making Lauren a dynamite player at DODGEBALL 27.\n----- DODGEBALL 13 vs. DODGEBALL 27 -----\nAt DODGEBALL 13, a captains feud pitting two of the \"same-names\" was etched in stone. \"The Battle of the Dans\" [Karen vs. Spengeman], one of the most remembered matches of all time, now has competition in the \"same-name\" category.\n\"The Battle of the Laurens\", Winston vs. Freda, was a fun but deadly rivalry. However, who won the match is currently a mystery for the current \"writer\" of dodgeball, whomever that may be. If anyone has the answer as to which team won, comment away!\n----- The Record Books -----\n> Lauren Winston, besides her outstanding play, became only the second person in history to be on the cover of an event poster [by themself]. The other, probably of no surprise, is John Tronolone. He is pictured on the DODGEBALL 13 poster.

She also headlined the inaugural event, DODGEBALL DAY 1, and DODGEBALL DAY 2, also against Valerie on those fateful September days.\n> Jack Mess, older brother of the Winston sisters, stepped onto the court at DODGEBALL 21 and became the oldest player at age 28. At DODGEBALL 27, he became the first player to ever smoke a cigar. What record will he break next?\n> At DODGEBALL 17, Travis Mills became the first man to hit \"rim\" with his entire team in play.
