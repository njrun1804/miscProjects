Brothers battle it out for all the bragging rights in this rare\nFamily Feud\nsiblings encounter!\nAnd it did not disappoint either!

Paul would have been so proud .. had he just shown up of course.\nNevertheless, the brothers themselves tangled in a few heated physical altercations - \"The Primaries\" if you will - each scoring decisive eliminations on the other.\nBut it was the overall score, the \"rEVOLution!\", that counted the most.\nFlash Results by Game\n:\nJames C. Butler defeated Michael Butler B.S., 6 - 1.\nJim: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7\nMike: 5\nOuch. Not what one would have expected, especially when looking at Jim's captains experience, or lack thereof really. But it's a huge victory for the 26 year-old, moving to 2-0-0.\nMoments & Stars\n: Mike Edwards parading around the court holding the over-sized, nearly-shredded Ron Paul sign in Game 1; the Smalls/Vetrano mid-court collision; Justin Wolf and Kevin Adams nailed two and three rimshots, respectively; the impressive showing from Michelle Mullins\nButler Beat Box 2\nSpecial thanks to Captain Michael Butler for the creation of a fantastically emergetic soundtrack.\nRECORDS\n> Attendance: 24\n> Notable Returns: Rob Avakian (last competed at DB 114); Joey Smalls (last competed at DB 116); Lauren Stopa (last competed at DB 116)\n> New Players: 0\n- DODGEBALL 121 kicked-off Season 13.\n- DODGEBALL 121 was held on the back courts of Wall High School for the 33rd consecutive event.
