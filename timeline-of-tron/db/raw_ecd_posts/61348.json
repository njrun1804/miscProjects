For the first time in his illustrious career, Justin Pierce takes center stage at a classic season finale extravaganza. A mainstay since the sport's inception, the multi-time award winner has just about seen it all. From his long-standing rivalry with Diana DiBuccio to his game-saving rimshots time and time again, Justin has accomplished what many wish they could in a year-plus tenure as a dodgeball superstar. But as a captain, not much is known of the wily veteran.\nDODGEBALL XXX4: April 7, 2006\nBilled as\nA Roll of the Dice\n, the 34th dodgeball spectacular witnessed history in the making. A first for the sport, teams were divided via a random drawing, where competitors of all ages, sizes, and genders picked numbers \"1\" or \"2\" out of a hat. But unbeknownst to those in attendance, two special \"captains\" cards were also included in the drawing, one of which belonged to \"The Piercer\". Along with poster-making rival Dan Spengeman, the two became on-court team generals for the evening in what would be Pierce's only time in the captain's chair. Unlike their past poster wars behind the scenes, it was \"QuickSand\" Dan picking up the victory in an extremely close encounter. The final score read 4 to 3.\nIt's been over a since that fateful day and you can bet \"The Piercer\" will be going all out to make this 90th spectacular one unforgettable night. The fearless and respected icon has everything to gain heading into this milestone event.\n......................................\nTOM ADAMS\nArguably, the most athletically gifted all-star to ever compete in the game of dodgeball. One of four famed Adams brothers, Tom Adams rose above the ranks immediately following his debut at DODGEBALL 8. His rocket arm and pinpoint accuracy have earned him tremendous offensive success. Paired with his agile dodging ability, he has truly become one of the finest all-around talents the game has ever seen.\nDODGEBALL 15: November 26, 2005\nRegarded as one of the most team-spirited events ever recorded, Tom Adams defeated the multi-talented Kurt Gassner in Tom's tryout captains confrontation. It was only a prelude of things to come.\nDODGEBALL 32: March 25, 2006\nRiding on the success of his inaugural bout, Tom did it again, this time taking down legend Ryan McCrorey in a highly-competitive\nWet War\n. It was another close call, but the third eldest Adams reigned supreme taking home the 6th and final game in this one.\nDODGEBALL 50: August 4, 2006\nWith the introduction of the now-popular pregame\nRimshot Contest\n, it was no secret Tom would do anything to become the contest\u2019s first winner and more importantly, earn the opportunity to challenge youngest brother Kevin and a hand-picked partner on the grandest stage of them all. As fate would have it, Tom, who would pair up with older brother Chris, somehow, someway, managed to defeat eight other teams vying for the same position. Kevin, to no ones' surprise, would choose the brother that started it all, the charismatic Steve, as the team co-captain.\nIn the wet, wild, and unpredictable war, victories would trade back and forth throughout the four-hour melee. In the end however, Kevin and Steve would emerge as the winning Adams duo, handing their other brothers the first losses of their storied careers.\nDODGEBALL 77: February 24, 2007\nOff the heels of just the second \"Slaughter Victory\" one week prior, the self-proclaimed \"Greek God\" decimated female titan Lauren Winston, earning an astounding 11 games out of a possible 14. With this victory, Tom's unblemished singles record remained in tact.\nQuite the list of fallen bodies Tom has put together. One must think, at least on paper, he is the solid favorite heading into DODGEBALL 90.\n________________________________________\n_________________________\nThe final preview coming up next!\nCheck back at the end of the week!",
