  "body_text": "It's already viewed as of one the most violent events ever ...\nNutshots, faceshots, and more turned XXX-SEVEN into a blood bath. The pain and suffering many felt was off the page.\nKyle Carty vs. Steve Adams\nIt was only fitting that Steve Adams would be captain mainly because the poster for the event featured him on the cover. Of course, that didn't help him on the court. His team felt the pain just as bad as he did.\nThe biggest slaughter in the history of the game came at XXX-SEVEN, when Kyle Carty destroyed the legend of Steve Adams with a score of 14 to 2. Never has there been such a captains battle massacre. Much credit is certainly deserving to Steve and his tenacious allies who fought tooth and nail right up until the end.\nFaceshots\nIt seems like head gear might be the way to go these days: just ask Lauren Winston. In a matter of seconds, her face turned swolen due to the horrendous faceshot she received from Kevin Adams. The Adams brothers are known for such hard-hitting action, but usually when the receiver is in-bounds. Lauren however just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time as she had just gotten back from getting a ball.\nThe \"Big Kat\" Zach Katz was also taken down after Tom Adams pelted him with a bulletball right in his right eye. It took Zach no more than two minutes to recover proving he is a tough competitor.\nNutshots\nIt has been talk for quite some time and after the most recent incidents, it doesn't seem like such a bad idea: All male players should wear protective cups.\nThe first of these shots was given to Ryan McCrorey. Ryan turned his head for one second, a second he'll most likely never forget. He went down immediately, and stayed down for almost 10 minutes. The man responsible for such an act was John Tronolone.\nTom Adams, a \"veteran\" in the world of nutshots, was noticibly thankful that the nutshot just witnessed was not perpetrated against him. However, as \"luck\" would have it, no more than 20 minutes after McCrorey's now infamous nutshot, Tom followed with the same fate. Tom is known for athletic dodges, but it's also the same talent that physically \"hurts\" him. With legs spread apart, he too went down hard and would soon be carried off the court. The wrath of John Tronolone was also responsible for this crime.\nTop Players\nKevin Megill has become arguably the best all around player in the history of dodgeball. His hands were hot at XXX-SEVEN, as catching and throwing were not a problem what so ever. His defense also highly ranked as he dodges easily and blocks perhaps better than anyone in the game.\nMike \"Sputz\", on his final day as a 20-year-old, showed superb catching ability. The catches for \"Sputz\" come very quick and sudden as he usually snags a good number of catches in just minutes time.\nThere isn't much to say about one Valerie Winston. Perhaps the most dominant female in history, Valerie in one game almost cleared out her entire opposition. Her secret throws have gained her main event status in the sport. She accomplished one of her goals too: eliminating John Tronolone [three times].\nRecords\n> Attendance : 27\n> New Players: (1) Mary\n> Biggest Returns:\nJack Mess (Last played at DODGEBALL 27)\nKyle Carty (Last played at DODGEBALL 30)\n> Steve Adams was captain for a record fourth time (previous times at X, TWENTY-SIX, and XXVIII). A returning Kyle Carty was captain for just the second time in his illustrious career. He led full force at the unforgettable DODGEBALL XONE against Mike Rozz.\n> The front courts of Wall High School were the night's \"venue\". This is a first since DODGEBALL 32.\n> There were no rims at DODGEBALL XXX-SEVEN.
