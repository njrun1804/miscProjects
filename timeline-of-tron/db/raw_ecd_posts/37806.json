At DODGEBALL 50, brothers Chris and Tom Adams secured their names in the record books for life, winning the first contest of its kind.\nAs the next events followed, what supposedly came off as a one-time only idea returned. Now a rimshot legend, Ryan Letsche would pull off not one but two huge victories for the right to face then-champion Kevin Adams.\nAt DODGEBALL 53, the world witnessed the first co-winners of such a contest. Unlike DODGEBALL 50 however, the two players would each become one-half of the night's main event, earning a captain's position against one another.\nDiana DiBuccio, Sara DeCuir, Kurt Gassner, John Tronolone, Chris Adams, Derek Carty, Kevin Adams, and Jim Martin all competed in the fourth rimshot contest to date.\nThe first round witnessed the rise of a single winner in Derek Carty. But left without an opponent he was. After round two, Diana, John, and Chris would move to the semis. It took a good few minutes, but in the end, Chris Adams was left standing.\nDerek Carty vs. Chris Adams\nTwo of the sports biggest icons closed out the first year of dodgeball in an epic encounter. Derek knew his past tries as team general were all so close, but had still yet to see his first win. Having only lost in the colossal team battle along with his three brothers at DODGEBALL 50, Chris remained a top singles captain with a 2 and 0 record.\nWith captains the caliber of Carty and Adams, there was no question that DODGEBALL 53 would go down as one of the most action-packed events ever!\nIt started off extremely well for Derek; the first three wins of the night. Despite Chris's tremendous showing, Derek's team as a whole appeared more focused. But of course things do change a lot in dodgeball don't they!\nAfter a good two-hours plus of intense competition, the score had seen a drastic change; all tied up! The final game would decide once and for all who walked out of DODGEBALL 53 as the victor. And unfortunately for Derek, he just happened to be on the losing end. The extra point went to the powerhouse Adams. The always resilient Derek Carty lost his fourth captains battle.\nChris Adams defeated Derek Carty at DODGEBALL 53, 6 - 5.\nThe Legend and The NewBlood\nChris Adams debuted some 50 events ago on September 10th, 2005. From that day forward, he became one of the most respected veterans to ever grace the dodgeball playing grounds. His success has never slowed, with proof of his dominance at DODGEBALL 53. In the early goings of the event, it was he who single-handedly carried the team. After several members of his team got their acts together, he was still a one-man wrecking crew. Key throwing eliminations, a number of life-saving rimshots, and athletic dodging allowed for teammates and opponents alike to only admire such a showing. And keep in mind, he was barefoot!\nDODGEBALL 50 was a great event for new-comer Brent Bitsko. Members of the opposing team that night voiced their frustrations after difficulty hitting the quick and agile dodger. Continuing off the success of his debut, he missed not one step at DODGEBALL 53. Dodging comes so natural to the youngster and offensively, pinpoint accuracy gave him much to brag about.\nThe One Year Anniversary ... DODGEBALL 54\nOne year ago, one man had a vision. It began at Ocean Road Park and it would change OUR world.\nCelebrate the 1st birthday of dodgeball when DODGEBALL 54 hits Ocean Road Park on Sunday, September 3, 2006.
