Where will I see you next? And wow, was that commercial awesome! The One Key (Mon-Key) along with the All Seeing eye/Mon-Star (one star), the DROID, and the hamburgler/freddy kruger/jupiter/tiger/checkerboard of duality traveling to all the places we love, the Vagus nerve, the sacred femin9 (statue of liberty), etc. Amazing archetypes displayed there! After all, these same themes keep coming up, right? Love, parents, the h[ero's]-LOVE journey (which now includes the pitfalls of college and jobs!), it's all very interesting to read about every1's journey through their eyes!",

I don't really look at this so much as a time line, but more so figuratively speaking, as a history book. Just like a history book back in the old days, the only thing highlighted were things that we had to remember. This John, is just another chapter in a verrryy long history book, that will continue to be highlighted throughout the years. I can only look forward in being part of it for many more years.

I made a prediction the other day with Trav and Steve. They heard me \"call it\"... it's going to be Undertaker/Michaels at WM26.... with a special guest referee of Bret Hart.
